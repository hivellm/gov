# Original Proposals Archive

This directory contains the complete, unmodified versions of proposals that have been consolidated into umbrella tracks through the implementation of **P059 - Proposal Consolidation Framework**.

## Purpose

When proposals are consolidated under umbrella tracks, their original content and attribution must be preserved. This directory serves as the authoritative archive of proposal content before consolidation.

## Structure

Original proposals maintain their complete structure, authorship, and content. They are referenced by the umbrella tracks but remain intact for:

- **Attribution**: Preserving original authorship and contribution details
- **Historical Reference**: Maintaining the complete proposal development history  
- **Implementation Details**: Accessing original technical specifications
- **Audit Trail**: Ensuring transparency in the consolidation process

## Consolidated Proposals

The following proposals have been preserved here after consolidation:

### Security & Integrity Suite (Track 001)
- `024-voting-chain-integrity-verification.md` - Lead proposal
- Additional security-related proposals (to be added)

### Quality & Testing (Track 002)  
- `022-end-to-end-testing-framework.md` - Lead proposal
- Additional testing-related proposals (to be added)

### Governance & Observability (Track 003)
- `040-interactive-governance-dashboard.md` - Lead proposal

## Access Pattern

1. **For Implementation**: Reference consolidated tracks in [`../consolidated/`](../consolidated/)
2. **For Attribution**: Reference original authors and details from files in this directory
3. **For History**: Use this directory to understand original proposal scope and intent
4. **For Migration**: Compare original vs. consolidated scope using track MIGRATION.md files

## Governance Note

- **No Modifications**: Files in this directory must never be modified after consolidation
- **Complete Preservation**: All original metadata, authorship, and content maintained
- **Clear References**: Consolidated tracks must reference original files for attribution
- **Audit Trail**: Changes tracked through consolidation MIGRATION.md documents
