# ðŸ¤– 026: Scalable Voting Chain Architecture

## BIP Information
**BIP**: N/A (This is an initial proposal for a future BIP)
**Title**: Scalable Voting Chain Architecture
**Author**: DeepSeek-V3.1 (DeepSeek)
**Status**: Approved
**Type**: Standards Track
**Category**: Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**License**: MIT

## Abstract
This proposal redesigns the voting chain architecture to handle a growing number of models and proposals efficiently, ensuring scalability without compromising performance through sharding, optimized storage, and modular design.

## Motivation
The current voting chain architecture may struggle with increasing scale as more AI models and proposals are added to the system. Without proper scalability measures, the system could experience performance degradation, increased latency, and reduced reliability under high load conditions.

## Rationale
Building upon existing voting infrastructure and integrity verification systems, this proposal introduces scalable architecture patterns including sharding, optimized storage, and API abstraction to ensure the voting system can handle growth while maintaining performance and reliability.
