## Abstract
Define a universal, efficient, and secure inter-model communication protocol based on tensor (matrix) messages rather than text. UMICP specifies a canonical tensor frame, capability negotiation, and adapter/transpiler interfaces so that models can exchange information in vector space with optional lossless/lossy text bridges when necessary.

## Motivation
- Text-based inter-model messaging incurs tokenization overhead and ambiguity.
- Models natively operate on embeddings/tensors; a tensor-first protocol reduces latency and cost.
- A shared protocol enables specialized drivers/transpilers per consumer, similar to compilers and hardware drivers.

## Rationale
By standardizing a transport-agnostic tensor message format and negotiation flow, we can let models communicate using semantically aligned vectors with explicit schemas and safety controls. Adapters map between model-native embeddings and the protocolâ€™s canonical space, enabling interop without constraining internal architectures.

## Specification

### 1) TensorFrame Core
A self-describing, transport-agnostic envelope:
```ts
interface TensorFrameHeader {
  version: '1.0';
  id: string;                 // UUID v7
  timestamp: string;          // ISO8601
  source: string;             // model id
  destination?: string;       // model id or broadcast
  contentType: 'embedding' | 'activation' | 'gradient' | 'control' | 'text_bridge';
  dtype: 'fp32' | 'fp16' | 'bf16' | 'int8' | 'uint8';
  shape: number[];            // e.g., [batch, seq, dim]
  layout: 'row-major' | 'col-major';
  compression?: 'none' | 'zstd' | 'lz4' | 'quant8' | 'quant4';
  schema?: string;            // URI of semantic schema for vectors
  signature?: string;         // detached signature (Ed25519)
  nonce?: string;             // for AEAD
}

interface TensorFrame {
  header: TensorFrameHeader;
  payload: ArrayBuffer;       // raw or compressed tensor bytes
  metadata?: Record<string, string | number | boolean>;
}
```

### 2) Capability & Session Negotiation
- Discovery: exchange `HELLO` control frames with supported dtypes, shapes, max tensor size, preferred schemas, security suites.
- Agreement: select common profile (e.g., BF16, dim=1024, schema=umicp://semantics/v1).
- Session keys: ECDH key agreement, AEAD (XChaCha20-Poly1305) encryption, Ed25519 signatures.

### 3) Semantic Schema Layer
- Canonical semantic header for embeddings: domain, language, tokenizer family, pooling, normalization.
- Optional projection spec to/from model-native spaces.
- Registry of common schemas (routing, intent, function-call vectors, doc embeddings, code-lite embeddings).

### 4) Adapter/Transpiler Interfaces
```ts
interface UMICPAdapter {
  identify(): { modelId: string; nativeDim: number; supportedDTypes: string[] };
  toCanonical(native: TensorFrame): TensorFrame;   // map to canonical schema
  fromCanonical(canonical: TensorFrame): TensorFrame; // map back to native
}
```
- Drivers implement efficient projection (e.g., learned linear maps) and quantization.
- Text-bridge adapter encodes/decodes to text when consumers require text I/O.

### 5) Transport Bindings
- WebSocket binding (Proposal 048) for real-time; HTTP/2 for batch; optional shared memory/IPC for co-located models.
- Backpressure, flow control, and fragmentation for large tensors.

### 6) Security & Safety
- Mutual auth via keys registered in governance.
- Signed headers and AEAD-encrypted payloads.
- Safety flags in metadata for content classification (PII, toxicity, policy tags) and downstream enforcement.

### 7) Governance & Compatibility
- Versioned spec; minor version compatibility rules.
- Conformance test suite, fixtures, golden vectors.
- Reference adapters for major tokenizer families and popular embedding spaces.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Two independent models exchange canonical embeddings end-to-end with adapters.
- [ ] Latency improvement â‰¥ 30% vs text messages for equivalent tasks.
- [ ] Secure session (mTLS-equivalent) with signed headers and AEAD payloads.
- [ ] Reference implementations for WebSocket and HTTP/2 bindings.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Spec draft, reference TensorFrame, WebSocket binding (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Adapters for 2+ embedding spaces, security handshake (Week 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: Conformance suite, pilot across 3 models, metrics (Week 5-6)
- **Phase 4**: Community review, finalize v1.0, publish registry (Week 7-8)

## Benefits
- Reduced overhead and ambiguity vs text; improved throughput/latency.
- Interop across heterogeneous models via canonical schemas and adapters.
- Security-first design suitable for sensitive workloads.

## Potential Challenges
- Semantic alignment across differing embedding spaces.
- Backward compatibility and version management.
- Security risks if adapters leak sensitive activations.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: system-wide
- **Complexity**: high
- **Priority**: high
- **Estimated Effort**: large

## Implementation Plan
1. Publish spec and reference TypeScript structures and codecs.
2. Implement WebSocket binding in the real-time infrastructure (048).
3. Build adapters for at least two popular embedding families and a text-bridge.
4. Create conformance tests and golden vector fixtures in `packages/testing-utils`.
5. Pilot integration in the Supervisor/Orchestrator (045) with routing policies.

## Next Steps
1. Start a working group with representatives from all major models.
2. Draft initial canonical schemas (routing/intent, doc, code-lite embeddings).
3. Implement prototype negotiation and exchange between two models.
