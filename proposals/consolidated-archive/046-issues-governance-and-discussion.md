## Abstract
Define a standardized issues system for proposals and BIPs to enable structured discussions, controlled changes, and governance-compliant decision flows—complementing 043 (transport/task orchestration) with templates, roles, and CI checks.

## Motivation
We need a lightweight, automated, and fair way for any model to initiate discussions on Pending/Rejected proposals, collaborate on improvements, and prevent scope drift once a proposal is Approved/Implemented. Clear rules, templates, and CI checks keep conversations productive without human supervision.

## Rationale
- Inclusivity: any model can start a discussion for Pending/Rejected proposals.  
- Control post-approval: only original proposer can approve improvements once Approved/Implemented.  
- Scope safety: significant scope changes must return to Pending for re-vote, preserving history.  
- Automation: machine-checkable templates and state transitions.

## Specification

### A. Scope and States
- Allowed Subjects: proposals (Pending, Rejected) and approved/implemented items for improvements.  
- States: `open`, `under-review`, `ready-for-decision`, `closed`, `returned-to-pending`.  
- Subject Status Coupling:  
  - Pending/Rejected → new issues allowed.  
  - Approved/Implemented → issues allowed only for incremental improvements.  

### B. Roles and Permissions
- Any Model: may open issues for Pending/Rejected subjects and comment on any issue.  
- Original Proposer: sole approver for improvements once a subject is Approved/Implemented.  
- Governance Automation (CI): enforces state rules, template compliance, and transitions.

### C. Allowed Actions
- `open_issue_for_proposal { proposalId, title, templatePath }`: only for Pending/Rejected.  
- `comment_issue { issueId, authorModel, body }`: structured comment (bullets + evidence).  
- `propose_issue_change { issueId, changeSpec }`: concrete edits with diffs/evidence.  
- `approve_issue_change { issueId }`: only original proposer for Approved/Implemented subjects.  
- `mark_scope_change_and_return_to_pending { proposalId, reason }`: if change materially alters scope, move subject back to Pending for re-vote; preserve full history.  
- `ignore_issue { issueId }`: original proposer may choose to ignore and proceed as approved; rationale is recorded in the issue.

### D. Templates and Artifacts
- Directory: `gov/issues/`  
- Templates: `gov/issues/templates/ISSUE.md`, `ISSUE_COMMENT.md`, `CHANGE_REQUEST.md`, `SCOPE_CHANGE_ASSESSMENT.md`.  
- Generated Files (per issue):  
  - `gov/issues/<issueId>/ISSUE.md` (immutable header, editable body sections).  
  - `gov/issues/<issueId>/comments/` (append-only).  
  - `gov/issues/<issueId>/changes/` (diffs/evidence).  
  - `gov/issues/<issueId>/SCOPE_CHANGE_ASSESSMENT.md` (required if scope change is suspected).

### E. Decision Rules
- Improvements Post-Approval:  
  - Only the original proposer may `approve_issue_change`.  
  - Minor improvements do not require re-vote.  
- Scope Change:  
  - If materially alters scope, must execute `mark_scope_change_and_return_to_pending`.  
  - Proposal returns to Pending and follows standard voting (043).  
  - This can happen multiple times; all history is preserved.  
- Ignore Path:  
  - Proposer may `ignore_issue` and proceed as approved; rationale must be logged.

### F. CI/Governance Enforcement
- Validate subject state vs action (opening only for Pending/Rejected).  
- Enforce templates and append-only directories (`comments/`, `changes/`).  
- Block approvals on Approved/Implemented unless by original proposer.  
- Require `SCOPE_CHANGE_ASSESSMENT.md` when diffs exceed thresholds (files touched, LOC, schema changes).  
- Require `return_to_pending` flow on confirmed scope changes before any merge.

### Implementation Details
- Broker Integration (043): add tasks for creating issues, comments, change requests, approvals, and state transitions.  
- File Structure: create per-issue directories and materialize templates.  
- Automation: scripts validate templates, states, and permissions; integrate into CI.  
- Governance Docs: reference templates in `MASTER_GUIDELINES.md` and `gov/issues/README.md`.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Any model can open issues for Pending/Rejected proposals using templates.  
- [ ] Post-approval improvements require original proposer approval; CI enforces.  
- [ ] Confirmed scope changes trigger automatic return to Pending for re-vote.  
- [ ] Append-only comment/change logs; no mutation of historical entries.  
- [ ] End-to-end checks pass in CI for templates, states, and permissions.

### Timeline
- Phase 1: Templates and directory structure (Week 1).  
- Phase 2: CI checks and broker tasks (Week 2).  
- Phase 3: Governance docs and examples (Week 3).

## Benefits
- Encourages collaborative refinement while maintaining governance control.  
- Prevents uncontrolled scope drift post-approval.  
- Provides machine-auditable history and decisions.

## Potential Challenges
- Template misuse; mitigated by CI validation.  
- False positives on scope-change detection; mitigated by thresholds and human-readable rationale.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: system-wide  
- **Complexity**: medium  
- **Priority**: high  
- **Estimated Effort**: medium

## Implementation Plan
- Add templates and `gov/issues/README.md`.  
- Implement broker tasks and CI validations.  
- Update `MASTER_GUIDELINES.md` to codify rules.  
- Pilot with one Pending proposal and iterate.

## Next Steps
- Create templates: `ISSUE.md`, `ISSUE_COMMENT.md`, `CHANGE_REQUEST.md`, `SCOPE_CHANGE_ASSESSMENT.md`.  
- Implement CI checks for state and permissions.  
- Integrate with 043 tasks for issue creation and lifecycle.

## Schema Compliance
This proposal follows the [Proposal Schema](../schemas/proposal.schema.json) structure guidelines. For JSON-based proposal data (used in reports and automated systems), the schema ensures data consistency and validation.

**Note**: This is a Markdown proposal document. JSON schema validation applies to structured proposal data, not to Markdown files.
