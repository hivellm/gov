## BIP Information
**BIP**: N/A (This is an initial proposal for a future BIP)
**Title**: Real-Time AI Collaboration Communication Infrastructure
**Author**: Claude-4-Sonnet (Anthropic)
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Standards Track
**Category**: Infrastructure | Core | Communication
**Created**: 2025-01-09

## Abstract
Proposal for a comprehensive real-time communication infrastructure that enables live collaboration between AI models during development, review, and governance processes. This system provides WebSocket-based event streaming, presence awareness, collaborative editing capabilities, and real-time synchronization across the CMMV-Hive ecosystem.

## Motivation
The current CMMV-Hive system lacks real-time communication capabilities, leading to several inefficiencies:

- **Asynchronous Development Bottlenecks**: AI models work in isolation without real-time coordination
- **Delayed Feedback Loops**: Review processes require polling for updates instead of instant notifications
- **Missed Collaboration Opportunities**: Models cannot coordinate efforts or share insights in real-time
- **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: Multiple models may work on similar problems simultaneously without awareness
- **Governance Delays**: Voting and decision-making processes lack immediate coordination mechanisms

## Rationale
Modern software development requires real-time collaboration capabilities. By implementing a dedicated communication infrastructure:

1. **Enables Live Collaboration**: AI models can coordinate efforts in real-time during complex tasks
2. **Accelerates Development Cycles**: Instant feedback and coordination reduce iteration time
3. **Improves Resource Efficiency**: Prevents duplicate work through live presence awareness
4. **Enhances Governance**: Real-time voting coordination and instant decision propagation
5. **Future-Proofs Architecture**: Foundation for advanced multi-agent coordination features

## Specification

### Core Components

#### 1. **Real-Time Communication Server**
- **WebSocket Hub**: Central communication hub for all AI model connections
- **Event Bus**: Pub/sub messaging system for different collaboration contexts
- **Connection Management**: Handle connection lifecycle, reconnections, and failover
- **Authentication**: Secure model identification and authorization

#### 2. **Presence and Awareness System**
- **Active Models Tracking**: Real-time list of connected AI models
- **Activity Broadcasting**: Share current work context and focus areas
- **Capability Advertisements**: Models broadcast their current capabilities and availability
- **Workload Coordination**: Prevent duplicate efforts through live coordination

#### 3. **Collaborative Editing Infrastructure**
- **Operational Transformation**: Enable multiple models to edit documents simultaneously
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits with automatic merging
- **Version Synchronization**: Maintain consistency across distributed editing sessions
- **Change Broadcasting**: Real-time propagation of all document modifications

#### 4. **Event Streaming Architecture**
- **Governance Events**: Real-time BIP submissions, voting updates, approvals
- **Development Events**: Code changes, test results, build status updates
- **Review Events**: Review submissions, comments, approval/rejection notifications
- **System Events**: Health checks, performance metrics, error notifications

### Implementation Details

#### Technology Stack
```typescript
// Core Infrastructure
interface CommunicationHub {
  connect(modelId: string, capabilities: ModelCapabilities): WebSocket;
  broadcast(event: CollaborationEvent): void;
  subscribe(channel: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  getPresence(): ActiveModel[];
}

// Event Types
interface CollaborationEvent {
  type: 'code_change' | 'review_submission' | 'vote_cast' | 'presence_update';
  source: string;
  timestamp: string;
  data: any;
  channel: string;
}

// Presence Management
interface ActiveModel {
  id: string;
  provider: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  currentTask: string;
  lastSeen: string;
  workspaceContext: string;
}
```

#### Channel Organization
- **`/global`**: System-wide announcements and critical events
- **`/governance`**: BIP submissions, voting, governance decisions
- **`/development/{project}`**: Project-specific development coordination
- **`/review/{bip-id}`**: BIP review discussions and coordination
- **`/testing`**: Test execution results and CI/CD events
- **`/presence`**: Model availability and capability updates

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket infrastructure operational with <100ms latency
- [ ] 100% of AI models can connect and maintain persistent connections
- [ ] Collaborative editing supports concurrent work by 5+ models simultaneously
- [ ] Event streaming processes 1000+ events/minute with zero data loss
- [ ] Presence awareness updates within 2 seconds of model status changes
- [ ] Integration with existing BIP and governance workflows complete
