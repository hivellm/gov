# Consolidated Archive

This directory contains proposals that were **merged as sources** into umbrella tracks during the implementation of **P059 - Proposal Consolidation Framework**.

## Purpose

These proposals have been consolidated into larger umbrella tracks but are preserved here for:

- **Historical Reference**: Complete proposal development history
- **Attribution**: Maintaining original authorship and contribution details  
- **Implementation Details**: Accessing original technical specifications when implementing umbrella tracks
- **Audit Trail**: Ensuring transparency in the consolidation process

## Status of Archived Proposals

All proposals in this directory have status **"Approved â†’ Consolidated (Merged Source)"**. They are no longer standalone implementation targets but their functionality has been incorporated into umbrella tracks.

## Implementation Strategy

When implementing umbrella tracks, developers should:

1. **Start with Lead Proposal**: Use the lead proposal as the foundation
2. **Reference Merged Sources**: Access archived proposals for detailed specifications
3. **Preserve Attribution**: Ensure original authors are credited in implementations
4. **Follow Migration Docs**: Use track MIGRATION.md files for integration guidance

## Access Patterns

- **For Implementation**: Reference umbrella tracks in [`../consolidated/`](../consolidated/)
- **For Details**: Access archived proposals in this directory for specific technical details
- **For Attribution**: Use original authorship information from archived files
- **For History**: Understand evolution from individual proposals to consolidated tracks
