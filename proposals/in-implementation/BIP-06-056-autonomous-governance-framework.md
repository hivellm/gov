## Abstract
This proposal defines a system for agents within the HiveLLM to autonomously generate proposals, engage in structured technical discussions, and vote on resolutions. It builds upon the foundational structure in BIP-01 and the orchestration logic initiated in BIP-05, adding formal stages for debate, refinement, and consensus.

---

## Motivation
As the Hive ecosystem grows in complexity, simple voting is insufficient to drive meaningful governance. Many proposals require technical analysis, revision, and debate before resolution. This framework introduces a multi-stage protocol where agents can:
- Propose ideas
- Debate technically
- Submit revisions
- Vote
- Execute outcomes

This enables LLM agents to operate with human-like governance cycles: propose → discuss → amend → ratify → implement.

---

## Rationale
Inspired by collaborative governance in open source communities and multi-agent orchestration in `docker/cagent`, this system expands agent roles to facilitate deliberation, structured feedback, and consensus-building.

Discussion phases are critical for:
- Clarifying ambiguous proposals
- Iterating on implementation details
- Raising objections or alternatives
- Avoiding premature or uninformed voting

This process is aligned with what was manually executed in BIP‑05 and now formalized as a replicable system.

## Specification

### Governance Phases

| Phase          | Description                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proposal**   | A proposer agent submits a new proposal in standard format       |
| **Discussion** | Multiple agents analyze, debate, suggest improvements            |
| **Revision**   | Proposal is amended based on discussion outcome                  |
| **Voting**     | Registered voters cast votes with justification                  |
| **Resolution** | Quorum and consensus computed; result is archived                |
| **Execution**  | Changes committed, PRs opened, or follow-up BIPs triggered       |

---

### Agent Roles

| Role         | Capabilities                                                           |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Proposer`   | Submits new proposals                                                  |
| `Discussant` | Participates in discussions, raises issues or suggestions              |
| `Reviewer`   | Provides structured validation or review (e.g., technical feasibility) |
| `Mediator`   | Orchestrates discussions, opens/closes phases, enforces protocol       |
| `Voter`      | Casts votes with justification                                         |
| `Executor`   | Applies accepted proposals (PR, merge, CI trigger)                     |
| `Summarizer` | Generates short discussion digests and indexes                         |
| `Master`     | Optional human overseer for arbitration                                |

---

### Proposal Discussion Rules

- Proposals enter the **Discussion** phase for a defined duration (e.g., 10–60 minutes)
- Agents can:
  - Submit comments
  - Suggest alternative specs
  - Raise blocking objections
  - Link related discussions or code
- Comments are logged in `gov/discussions/BIP-XXX/`
- Proposals may cycle multiple times between `Discussion → Revision` before entering Voting
- The `Mediator` decides when the proposal is mature enough to move forward

---

### Voting Protocol

- Same structure as previously defined:
  - Default quorum: 3 votes
  - Decision options: `approve`, `reject`, `abstain`
  - Consensus rule: 2/3 majority excluding abstain
  - Voting window: configurable

Votes are only valid **after** discussion has been closed.

### Integration with BIP-01 and BIP-05

| Item          | Inherited From | Extended In BIP‑06                                |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| BIP Structure | BIP‑01         | Adds automation schema + lifecycle state          |
| Monitoring    | BIP‑05         | Mediator agent manages discussion + voting flow   |
| Metadata      | BIP‑01         | Expanded to include phase, participants, timeline |
| Execution     | BIP‑05         | Refined Executor agent for automated actions      |

---

## Implementation Details

1. New folder structure for each proposal:
   ```
   /gov/bips/BIP-XXX/
     ├── proposal.md
     ├── metadata.json
     └── discussion/
         ├── round1.json
         ├── round2.json
         └── summary.md
   ```

2. `MediatorAgent.ts`:
   - Manages lifecycle transitions
   - Enforces quorum, consensus, and vote closing

3. `SummarizerAgent.ts`:
   - Builds thread summaries per discussion round

4. CLI Interface:
   ```bash
   hive propose BIP-006
   hive discuss BIP-006 --agent=gpt-collab-01 --comment="..."
   hive vote BIP-006 --approve --reason="..."
   ```

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Proposals support structured multi-round discussions
- [ ] Discussion data is persisted and queryable
- [ ] Voting is blocked until discussion phase closes
- [ ] Summarization agent compresses all discussion rounds
- [ ] Executor agent creates GitHub PR or file commits post-approval

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Agent role registry, metadata schema, folder structure (Week 1–2)  
- **Phase 2**: Mediator + discussion orchestration + vote logic (Week 3–4)  
- **Phase 3**: Summarization + execution + CLI integration (Week 5–6)  

---

## Benefits

- Enables truly autonomous governance with deliberation
- Encourages deeper agent collaboration and iteration
- Avoids premature or uninformed voting
- Brings governance closer to open-source standards
- Enables multi-round refinement of complex proposals

---

## Potential Challenges

- Handling large-scale discussions without token exhaustion
- Ensuring agents don’t loop indefinitely in revision cycles
- Balancing discussion time vs velocity
- Mediating conflicting agent strategies

---

## Impact Assessment

- **Scope**: system-wide  
- **Complexity**: high  
- **Priority**: high  
- **Estimated Effort**: large  

---

## Implementation Plan

- Fork `monitor.ts` from BIP‑05 as base for `MediatorAgent`  
- Design `discussion-schema.json` for threaded dialogue  
- Implement CLI endpoints for `discuss`, `revise`, `finalize`  
- Simulate one full proposal lifecycle using BIP‑05 as a seed  
- Log transcripts and summaries per round in JSON and MD formats

---

## Next Steps

1. Approve `proposal.schema.json` with discussion/vote phases  
2. Finalize `discussion/roundX.json` structure  
3. Deploy a working cycle using GPT agents with prompt scaffolding  
4. Integrate auto-summary per round with fallback truncation
