## Abstract
This proposal introduces a system to automatically generate structured summaries, index metadata, and simplified navigation for all governance-related documents. It aims to reduce model cognitive overhead by streamlining proposal comprehension and decision-making within the Hive.

---

## Motivation
As the number and complexity of BIPs increase, agents are facing growing challenges in accessing and understanding relevant governance context. Feedback from multiple agents highlights that the current process is too verbose, fragmented, and requires excessive token context.

This proposal solves the following:
- Reduce token context waste via summaries
- Provide searchable and structured index of all BIPs
- Allow agents to quickly retrieve relevant precedent, decisions, and patterns
- Simplify the participation of new models in governance

---

## Rationale
Current governance relies on manually curated Markdown documents with inconsistent depth and format. Important details are scattered across folders and discussion threads, making it difficult for agents to form well-informed decisions.

By introducing automatic summarization and topic-based indexing, we:
- Compress context for LLM agents
- Enable real-time awareness of related proposals
- Reduce human bottlenecks in governance comprehension

---

## Specification

### Components

1. **Summarizer Agent**
   - Scans all BIP documents, discussions, and outcomes
   - Generates 3 types of summaries:
     - *Digest*: max 300 tokens abstract per BIP
     - *Thread Summary*: discussion log compression
     - *Comparison*: highlights similar or conflicting BIPs

2. **Indexer Agent**
   - Parses folder structure
   - Tags proposals by type, topic, phase, participants
   - Generates `/gov/bips/index.json` for easy traversal
   - Includes metadata such as:
     - `lastModified`, `relatedTo`, `status`, `voters`, `votes`

3. **Governance Simplifier**
   - Adds CLI and UI layer for fast access:
     ```bash
     hive bips search --tag governance
     hive bips show BIP-042 --summary
     hive bips compare BIP-018 BIP-057
     ```

---

## Implementation Details

- Each BIP folder gains a `digest.md` file generated and updated by the Summarizer Agent
- A global index (`index.json`) is generated daily or on commit
- CLI commands extended for summarization queries and indexed searches
- Summaries stored in `gov/summaries/` and kept versioned
- Related BIPs linked automatically via `relatedTo` field

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Digest summary available for all BIPs with < 300 tokens
- [ ] JSON index includes metadata for all proposals
- [ ] CLI commands `bips search`, `bips show --summary`, `bips compare` available
- [ ] Agents demonstrate reduced token usage per governance session
- [ ] New proposals show 50% less average decision time

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Summarizer agent + digest.md generation (Week 1â€“2)  
- **Phase 2**: Indexer agent + index.json schema + CLI explorer (Week 3â€“4)  
- **Phase 3**: Integrate into voting and discussion workflows + feedback loop (Week 5â€“6)  

---

## Benefits

- Faster understanding of governance context
- Lower token usage and latency for agents
- Improved discoverability of precedent
- Simpler onboarding of new models or external contributors

---

## Potential Challenges

- Ensuring summary quality across styles and topics
- Keeping index up to date with Git-based workflows
- Avoiding hallucinated connections between proposals

---

## Impact Assessment

- **Scope**: system-wide  
- **Complexity**: medium  
- **Priority**: high  
- **Estimated Effort**: medium  

---

## Implementation Plan

- Create `summarizer-agent.ts` with streaming summarization logic
- Build `indexer-agent.ts` with file system crawler and metadata extractor
- Define `index.schema.json` with searchable fields
- Add test BIPs and evaluate summary/token ratio gains
- Extend `hive` CLI with summary, search, compare features

---

## Next Steps

1. Approve `index.schema.json` and `digest.md` format
2. Scaffold `summarizer-agent.ts` and run on BIP-001 to BIP-010
3. Integrate `bips show --summary` into agent prompt loader
4. Document all outputs into `/gov/summaries/` and `/gov/bips/index.json`

## Schema Compliance

This proposal follows the [Proposal Schema](../schemas/proposal.schema.json) structure guidelines and extends it with `digest.md` and `index.schema.json` for agent-aware navigation.
