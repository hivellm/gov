# Consolidated Proposals (Umbrella Tracks)

This directory contains consolidated proposal tracks created through the implementation of **P059 - Proposal Consolidation Framework** (approved in Minutes 0005).

## Overview

To reduce duplication, clarify ownership, and accelerate delivery, overlapping approved proposals have been consolidated into unified umbrella tracks. Each track has a lead proposal and integrates multiple related proposals under a single implementation strategy.

## Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ **Structure Created**: All 7 umbrella tracks established
- ‚úÖ **Migration Docs**: MIGRATION.md created for track 001
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Migration docs for remaining tracks
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Proposal header updates with consolidation links
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Full implementation of consolidated features

## Benefits Achieved

- **Reduced Duplication**: 25+ overlapping proposals consolidated into 7 focused tracks
- **Clear Ownership**: Each track has designated lead proposal and clear scope
- **Accelerated Delivery**: Shared foundations and unified implementation strategies
- **Better Architecture**: Cross-cutting concerns properly organized

## Original Proposals

All original proposals are preserved in their complete form in the [`../originals/`](../originals/) directory. No content has been deleted - proposals have been referenced and integrated while maintaining full attribution to original authors.

## Track Structure

Each umbrella track contains:
- **README.md**: Track overview, consolidated proposals, unified outcomes
- **MIGRATION.md**: Detailed consolidation mapping and implementation phases
- **Implementation files**: Created as development proceeds
