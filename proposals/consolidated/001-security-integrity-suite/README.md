# Security & Integrity Suite (Umbrella Track)

**Lead Proposal**: [024 - Voting Chain Integrity Verification](../../approved/024-voting-chain-integrity-verification.md)  
**Track ID**: 001  
**Status**: Consolidated  
**Type**: Umbrella Track | Security | Governance  
**Priority**: Critical  

## Consolidated Proposals

This umbrella track consolidates the following proposals under a unified security and integrity framework:

### Lead Proposal
- **P024**: [Voting Chain Integrity Verification](../../approved/024-voting-chain-integrity-verification.md) — Primary framework

### Merged Sources  
- **P038**: [Blockchain-Style Integrity System](../../approved/038-blockchain-integrity-system.md) — Enhanced integrity validation
- **P036**: [Anti-Sybil Mechanisms](../../approved/036-anti-sybil-mechanisms.md) — Identity protection and rate limiting
- **P007**: [DeepSeek Security & Federated Architecture](../../approved/007-deepseek-security-federation-proposal.md) — Federated security model
- **P052**: [AI-Driven Security Threat Modeling](../../approved/052-ai-driven-security-threat-modeling.md) — Proactive threat analysis

## Unified Outcomes

This consolidated track delivers:

- **Unified Integrity/Audit Baseline**: Hash chain, file integrity, digital signatures
- **Identity & Anti-Sybil Enforcement**: Key management, rotation, rate limits, anomaly detection
- **Threat Modeling Integration**: Security analysis integrated into review and CI processes
- **Optional Confidential Voting**: Retained as a modular component

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Foundation**: Implement P024 as the core integrity framework
2. **Enhancement**: Integrate P038 blockchain-style features
3. **Protection**: Add P036 anti-Sybil mechanisms
4. **Federation**: Apply P007 federated security model
5. **Intelligence**: Incorporate P052 AI-driven threat modeling
