# Scalability & Performance Program (Umbrella Track)

**Lead Proposal**: [026 - Scalable Voting Chain Architecture](../../approved/026-scalable-voting-chain-architecture.md)  
**Track ID**: 005  
**Status**: Consolidated  
**Type**: Umbrella Track | Infrastructure | Performance  
**Priority**: High  

## Consolidated Proposals

### Lead Proposal
- **P026**: [Scalable Voting Chain Architecture](../../approved/026-scalable-voting-chain-architecture.md) — Core scalability framework

### Merged Sources  
- **P027**: [Performance Optimization Pipeline](../../approved/027-grok-code-fast-1-performance-optimization-pipeline.md) — Optimization systems
- **P006**: [Claude‑4‑Sonnet Enhancements](../../approved/006-claude4-sonnet-enhancement-proposal.md) — Model enhancements

## Unified Outcomes

- **Core Architecture**: Sharding, caching, batching + ongoing performance program
- **SLOs**: Latency, throughput, and cost targets with shared benchmarks
- **Performance Pipeline**: Continuous optimization and monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Architecture**: Implement P026 as the core scalability framework
2. **Optimization**: Integrate P027 performance pipeline
3. **Enhancements**: Apply P006 model enhancement patterns
