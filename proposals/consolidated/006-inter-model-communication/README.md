# Inter-Model Communication & Collaboration (Umbrella Track)

**Lead Proposal**: [054 - Universal Matrix-Based Protocol](../../approved/054-universal-matrix-based-inter-model-communication-protocol.md)  
**Track ID**: 006  
**Status**: Consolidated  
**Type**: Umbrella Track | Communication | Collaboration  
**Priority**: Critical  

## Consolidated Proposals

### Lead Proposal
- **P054**: [Universal Matrix-Based Protocol](../../approved/054-universal-matrix-based-inter-model-communication-protocol.md) — Core communication protocol

### Merged Sources  
- **P048**: [Real-Time Collaboration Infrastructure](../../approved/048-real-time-ai-collaboration-communication-infrastructure.md) — Real-time collaboration
- **P043**: [Event-Driven Queue Consumer](../../approved/043-event-driven-queue-consumer.md) — Event-driven architecture
- **P050**: [Bidirectional Feedback System](../../approved/050-bidirectional-feedback-system.md) — Feedback mechanisms

## Unified Outcomes

- **Protocol + Transport**: UMICP with eventing + feedback channels aligned
- **Typed Routing**: Reliable message routing and delivery
- **Near-Real-Time**: Collaboration guarantees and low-latency communication

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Protocol**: Implement P054 as the core communication framework
2. **Real-Time**: Integrate P048 collaboration infrastructure
3. **Events**: Add P043 event-driven architecture
4. **Feedback**: Incorporate P050 bidirectional feedback systems
