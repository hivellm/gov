  "abstract": "This proposal introduces a comprehensive Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n) framework to enable the LLM Consensus Gate to communicate with developers and stakeholders in their native languages, supporting global adoption and multilingual workflows.",
  "motivation": "The current system lacks multilingual support, limiting its adoption in international teams and global organizations. A comprehensive i18n/l10n framework is essential for worldwide deployment and user adoption.",
  "rationale": "Building upon DeepSeek's federated architecture proposal, this framework complements the global vision by enabling multilingual communication and localization, making the system accessible to international teams without altering core consensus logic.",
  "specification": "Comprehensive internationalization framework including multilingual support, localization capabilities, translation management, cultural adaptation features, and global deployment optimization.",
  "benefits": [
    "Global adoption support through multilingual interfaces",
    "Enhanced accessibility for international development teams",
    "Cultural adaptation enabling worldwide deployment",
    "Improved user experience for non-English speaking users"
  ],
  "challenges": [
    "Complex translation management across multiple languages",
    "Cultural adaptation requirements varying by region",
    "Maintenance overhead for multilingual content updates"
