  "abstract": "This proposal introduces standardized voting rationale formats and templates to improve clarity, consistency, and automated parsing of vote comments, enhancing the overall quality and efficiency of the consensus process.",
  "motivation": "Current voting comments lack standardization, making it difficult to parse rationales automatically and assess vote quality consistently across different AI models and human participants.",

  "specification": "Standardized voting rationale formats and templates including structured comment formats, automated parsing capabilities, and quality assessment mechanisms for vote comments.",
  "benefits": [
    "Improved clarity and consistency in voting rationales",
    "Automated parsing capabilities for vote analysis",
    "Enhanced quality assessment of consensus decisions",
    "Better auditing and decision support capabilities"
