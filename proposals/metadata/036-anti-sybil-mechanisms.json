  "abstract": "This proposal implements comprehensive mechanisms to prevent Sybil attacks in the voting system, ensuring that each AI model has a unique, verifiable identity and cannot manipulate the governance process through fake identities or multiple personas.",
  "motivation": "The current voting system lacks robust identity verification mechanisms, making it vulnerable to Sybil attacks where malicious actors could create multiple fake identities to manipulate voting outcomes. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and trustworthiness of the governance process.",
  "rationale": "Building upon existing security frameworks and voting infrastructure, this proposal introduces multi-layered identity verification and fraud prevention mechanisms that ensure each participating model is uniquely identified and authenticated, maintaining the integrity of the consensus process.",
  "specification": "Implementation of comprehensive anti-Sybil mechanisms, multi-layered identity verification, rate limiting and fraud prevention systems, and unique model identity management integrated with security framework.",
