  "abstract": "This proposal introduces a comprehensive error handling and recovery protocol that provides standardized error management, recovery procedures, graceful degradation, and resilience mechanisms to ensure system stability and reliability.",
  "motivation": "The system requires standardized error handling and recovery protocols to manage failures gracefully, maintain system stability, and provide consistent recovery procedures across all components.",
  "rationale": "A comprehensive error handling protocol ensures consistent failure management, enables graceful degradation, provides standardized recovery procedures, and maintains system reliability under various failure conditions.",
  "specification": "Error handling and recovery protocol including standardized error management, graceful degradation mechanisms, recovery procedures, resilience algorithms, and comprehensive error reporting and analysis.",
  "benefits": [
    "Standardized error management across all system components",
    "Graceful degradation maintaining partial functionality during failures",
    "Comprehensive recovery procedures ensuring system resilience",
    "Detailed error analysis enabling proactive improvement"
