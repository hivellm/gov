  "abstract": "This proposal consolidates overlapping proposals that are currently Approved or Pending into a small set of umbrella tracks. The aim is to reduce duplication, clarify ownership, and accelerate delivery while preserving the original intent and attribution of each source proposal.",
  "motivation": "Multiple Approved and Pending proposals target similar problem spaces (security/integrity, testing/validation/benchmarks, observability/knowledge, review governance, scalability/performance, inter-model communication). Unifying these into umbrella tracks reduces coordination cost, establishes clearer milestones, improves architectural coherence, and accelerates implementation.",
  "rationale": "Umbrella tracks provide a portfolio view with well-defined boundaries and shared primitives. Only proposals in Approved and Pending directories are included to respect governance outcomes and avoid reintroducing rejected scopes.",
  "specification": "Consolidation framework creating umbrella tracks with lead proposals and merge sources, including Security & Integrity Suite, Quality Testing & Validation, Governance Observability Platform, Review Governance Suite, Scalability & Performance Program, Inter-Model Communication, and Model Governance Registry.",
