  "abstract": "Attach a lightweight queue + consumer service to BIP-00 that launches a local WebSocket stream server on a high port. A Client submits typed TASKs; one or more Consumers execute them (e.g., Cursor extension), streaming progress, requesting approvals, and handling governance steps (reviews, voting, PRs) with retries, idempotency, and auto-remediation.",
  "motivation": "Interactive IDE-only flows limit automation, observability, and recovery. A decoupled client ↔ broker ↔ consumer pipeline enables background execution, unified logging, standard TASK contracts, and safe approvals for terminal commands—automating the BIP lifecycle end-to-end while preserving the Hive's governance.",
  "rationale": "Decoupling unlocks concurrency, backpressure, and retries. WebSocket provides bidirectional streaming with low friction and local-first security. Typed TASKs encode governance and repo operations explicitly. Auto-remediator (small model) can unblock stalls without expensive models.",
  "specification": "Implementation of event-driven task queue and consumer automation service, WebSocket-based workflow management system, typed task contracts with governance integration, auto-remediation capabilities for stuck processes, and background execution with approval workflows.",
