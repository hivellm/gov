  "abstract": "This proposal implements a single, authoritative Model Registry for HiveLLM that unifies model metadata, roles, lifecycle status, and evaluation links across the repository, while enforcing governance classifications and maintaining schema consistency.",
  "motivation": "As the number of models, files, and evaluation artifacts grows, the current scattered approach leads to duplicated and inconsistent metadata. Model details are fragmented across multiple JSON files and documentation, governance classifications are inconsistently enforced, and there's no standardized schema versioning or deprecation handling.",
  "rationale": "Building upon existing model management and governance frameworks, this proposal establishes a unified registry system that provides a single source of truth for all model metadata, enforces governance role rules (particularly the generals classification for large models only), and ensures consistency across the entire ecosystem.",
  "specification": "Implementation of unified model registry with single source of truth architecture, governance classification engine enforcing role-based rules, lifecycle management system for model status tracking, versioned JSON schema for consistent metadata structure, and CRUD operations with validation and policy enforcement.",
