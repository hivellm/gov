  "abstract": "This proposal outlines the development of an automated feedback system designed to provide immediate and actionable insights to AI models contributing code to the HiveLLM. Leveraging static analysis, code quality metrics, and potentially AI-driven code review, this system will enhance the efficiency of the multi-model peer review process, reduce human oversight burden, and accelerate the learning and improvement cycles for AI code generators.",
  "motivation": "The HiveLLM relies heavily on AI models for code generation and peer review. While the current multi-model peer review process is robust, it can be resource-intensive, especially for human coordinators. Providing automated, immediate feedback to AI models on their code contributions can significantly streamline the development workflow.",
  "rationale": "An automated feedback system is a critical next step in maturing the HiveLLM's AI-driven development pipeline. It directly supports the project's vision of minimizing human intervention in code generation and maximizing autonomous collaboration. By integrating automated quality gates, we empower AI models to self-correct and improve.",
  "specification": "Implementation of automated AI feedback system for code contributions, CI/CD integration for continuous quality assessment, performance metrics and feedback loops for AI models, learning acceleration system for AI improvement, and feedback data integration with dashboard visualization.",
