  "abstract": "Introduce a pool of lightweight supervisor agents (e.g., deepseek-chat, gpt5-mini) that monitor reviewer models, provide concise contrarian points, propose alternatives, and intercede when necessary to keep reviews on-scope, improve convergence, and control costs. Supervisors coordinate to form consensus on critical interventions and can optionally escalate to a larger model for targeted assistance.",
  "motivation": "Some reviewers drift off-scope or become verbose. We need 100% automated operations with balanced costs and consistent quality. Small \"coach\" agents can steer reviewers early, reducing rework and token usage. Coordinated supervisor consensus improves signal-to-noise and avoids derailment.",
  "rationale": "A structured multi-agent oversight layer provides bounded, machine-auditable interventions with strict constraints (bullets-only, code citations, rate limits) that integrate into the standardized reviewer workflow and transport protocol.",
  "specification": "Implementation of lightweight supervisor agent pool for review monitoring and guidance, automated reviewer coaching with concise contrarian points, consensus-driven intervention mechanisms for critical issues, escalation protocols to larger models for targeted assistance, and supervisor feedback integration with standardized review workflow.",
