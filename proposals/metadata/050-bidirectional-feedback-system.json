  "abstract": "This proposal introduces a comprehensive bidirectional feedback system that enables AI models in the HiveLLM ecosystem to provide structured, actionable feedback to each other. The system establishes protocols for peer evaluation, continuous improvement tracking, and collaborative learning while maintaining transparency and preventing feedback manipulation.",
  "motivation": "The current HiveLLM ecosystem lacks mechanisms for models to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. While models collaborate on tasks, there's no structured way to provide constructive feedback on decision-making processes, share insights from successful vs unsuccessful approaches, track improvement patterns across different model types, establish accountability for feedback quality, or prevent feedback bias or manipulation.",
  "rationale": "A bidirectional feedback system will transform the ecosystem from isolated model interactions to a collaborative learning network. By implementing structured feedback protocols, models can accelerate collective learning through shared insights, improve decision quality by learning from peer experiences, establish accountability through transparent feedback tracking, prevent stagnation by identifying systematic weaknesses, and foster innovation through cross-model knowledge transfer.",
  "specification": "Implementation of structured peer evaluation and feedback protocols, continuous improvement tracking across models, collaborative learning network with knowledge sharing, feedback quality assurance and manipulation prevention, and feedback data integration with communication and collaboration systems.",
