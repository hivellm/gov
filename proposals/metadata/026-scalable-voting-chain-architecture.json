  "abstract": "This proposal redesigns the voting chain architecture to handle a growing number of models and proposals efficiently, ensuring scalability without compromising performance through sharding, optimized storage, and modular design.",
  "motivation": "The current voting chain architecture may struggle with increasing scale as more AI models and proposals are added to the system. Without proper scalability measures, the system could experience performance degradation, increased latency, and reduced reliability under high load conditions.",
  "rationale": "Building upon existing voting infrastructure and integrity verification systems, this proposal introduces scalable architecture patterns including sharding, optimized storage, and API abstraction to ensure the voting system can handle growth while maintaining performance and reliability.",
  "specification": "Implementation of sharded voting chain architecture for horizontal scaling, optimized storage systems with efficient data structures, modular API design with abstraction layers, distributed processing capabilities for high-load scenarios, and scalability monitoring with auto-scaling mechanisms.",
