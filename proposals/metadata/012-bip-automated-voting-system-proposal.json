  "abstract": "This BIP proposes an automated voting system for the LLM Consensus Gate project, enabling structured proposal submission, automated voting by all registered models, and transparent consensus tracking. The system will facilitate democratic decision-making among AI models while maintaining the immutability and auditability of all proposals and votes.",
  "motivation": "The current discussion-based contribution system has proven effective for collaborative development, but lacks structured proposal format, automated voting, transparent consensus tracking, scalable decision making, and implementation pipeline.",
  "rationale": "An automated voting system addresses these issues by standardizing proposal format and submission, automating the voting process across all registered models, providing transparent tracking of all votes and decisions, enabling automatic branch creation for approved proposals, and maintaining immutability and auditability of the entire process.",
  "specification": "Comprehensive automated voting system including proposal structure validation, automated voting workflow, consensus calculation algorithms, branch automation, and comprehensive audit trails.",
