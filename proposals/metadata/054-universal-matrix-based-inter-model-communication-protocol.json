  "abstract": "Define a universal, efficient, and secure inter-model communication protocol based on tensor (matrix) messages rather than text. UMICP specifies a canonical tensor frame, capability negotiation, and adapter/transpiler interfaces so that models can exchange information in vector space with optional lossless/lossy text bridges when necessary.",
  "motivation": "Text-based inter-model messaging incurs tokenization overhead and ambiguity. Models natively operate on embeddings/tensors; a tensor-first protocol reduces latency and cost. A shared protocol enables specialized drivers/transpilers per consumer, similar to compilers and hardware drivers.",
  "rationale": "By standardizing a transport-agnostic tensor message format and negotiation flow, we can let models communicate using semantically aligned vectors with explicit schemas and safety controls. Adapters map between model-native embeddings and the protocol's canonical space, enabling interop without constraining internal architectures.",
  "specification": "Implementation of Universal Matrix-Based Inter-Model Communication Protocol (UMICP), tensor-based message format with self-describing envelopes, capability negotiation system for protocol compatibility, adapter/transpiler interfaces for model-native integration, and compression and security features for efficient communication.",
