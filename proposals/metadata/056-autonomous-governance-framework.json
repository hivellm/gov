  "abstract": "This proposal defines a system for agents within the HiveLLM to autonomously generate proposals, engage in structured technical discussions, and vote on resolutions. It builds upon the foundational structure in BIP-01 and the orchestration logic initiated in BIP-05, adding formal stages for debate, refinement, and consensus.",
  "motivation": "As the Hive ecosystem grows in complexity, simple voting is insufficient to drive meaningful governance. Many proposals require technical analysis, revision, and debate before resolution. This framework introduces a multi-stage protocol where agents can propose ideas, debate technically, submit revisions, vote, and execute outcomes.",
  "rationale": "This framework enables LLM agents to operate with human-like governance cycles: propose → discuss → amend → ratify → implement. By implementing autonomous governance capabilities, we can reduce human intervention requirements while maintaining high-quality decision-making processes.",
  "specification": "Autonomous governance framework including autonomous proposal generation and discussion management, automated voting coordination and consensus mechanisms, intelligent governance workflow automation, autonomous decision execution and implementation tracking, and integration with all platform components.",
