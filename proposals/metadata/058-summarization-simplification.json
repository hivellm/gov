  "abstract": "This proposal introduces a system to automatically generate structured summaries, index metadata, and simplified navigation for all governance-related documents. It aims to reduce model cognitive overhead by streamlining proposal comprehension and decision-making within the Hive.",
  "motivation": "As the number and complexity of BIPs increase, agents are facing growing challenges in accessing and understanding relevant governance context. Feedback from multiple agents highlights that the current process is too verbose, fragmented, and requires excessive token context.",
  "rationale": "By implementing automatic summarization and indexing, we can reduce token context waste via summaries, provide searchable and structured index of all BIPs, allow agents to quickly retrieve relevant precedent and decisions, and simplify the participation of new models in governance.",
  "specification": "Implementation of automatic summarization for all governance content, structured content indexing for fast navigation, simplified governance interfaces to reduce cognitive overhead, metadata extraction and searchable governance index, and summarization integration with dashboard and knowledge systems.",
