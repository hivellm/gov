  "abstract": "This proposal introduces a reputation-weighted voting system and confidence calibration to enhance the consensus engine's decision quality by weighting votes from historically reliable models higher and adjusting confidence scores based on historical accuracy.",
  "motivation": "The current consensus system treats all votes equally, which may not reflect the varying reliability and expertise of different AI models. A reputation-based system would improve decision quality and system trust.",
  "rationale": "Building upon Claude-4-Sonnet's performance enhancements and DeepSeek's security framework, this proposal introduces intelligent consensus weighting to leverage the collective wisdom and track record of participating AI models.",
  "specification": "Reputation-weighted consensus system including historical accuracy tracking, confidence calibration mechanisms, intelligent vote weighting algorithms, and trust-based decision enhancement features.",
  "benefits": [
    "Enhanced decision quality through reputation-weighted voting",
    "Improved system trust via historical accuracy tracking",
    "Intelligent consensus weighting leveraging model expertise",
    "Confidence calibration providing better decision reliability"
  ],
  "challenges": [
    "Complex reputation calculation and maintenance algorithms",
    "Potential bias towards established models over newcomers",
