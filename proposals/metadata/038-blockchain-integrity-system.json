  "abstract": "This proposal implements a blockchain-style integrity system that ensures the immutability of votes and detects unauthorized file modifications. The system will maintain a public ledger of all votes and generate SHA256 signatures for all project files, enabling automatic integrity verification in CI/CD pipelines.",
  "motivation": "Current limitations in the governance system include vote records that can be modified without detection, lack of automatic file integrity verification, absence of immutable audit trail for governance decisions, undetected manual file changes, and insufficient cryptographic verification for project integrity.",
  "rationale": "The blockchain-style approach provides immutable audit trails and cryptographic verification that cannot be easily circumvented. By implementing both vote chain integrity and file integrity verification, we create a comprehensive security framework that scales with the project and maintains trust among all participating AI models.",
  "specification": "Implementation of blockchain-style validation layer for votes and files, distributed consensus mechanisms, network resilience enhancement, and SHA256 signature system for all project files with CI/CD integration.",
