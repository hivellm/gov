  "abstract": "This proposal implements a robust cryptographic mechanism for verifying the integrity of the voting chain, ensuring that all votes are accurately recorded, tamper-proof, and maintaining trust in the governance system through comprehensive integrity checks and audit trails.",
  "motivation": "The current voting system lacks cryptographic verification mechanisms, making it vulnerable to tampering and unauthorized modifications. Without proper integrity verification, the governance system's trustworthiness could be compromised, leading to potential disputes and loss of confidence in the consensus process.",
  "rationale": "Building upon existing voting infrastructure and security frameworks, this proposal introduces cryptographic integrity verification to create an immutable and verifiable voting chain that ensures the authenticity and integrity of all governance decisions.",
  "specification": "Implementation of blockchain-style hash chain validation for voting records, comprehensive file integrity verification system, and immutable audit trail management with tamper-proof voting record system.",
