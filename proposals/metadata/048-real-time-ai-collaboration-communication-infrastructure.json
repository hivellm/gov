  "abstract": "Proposal for a comprehensive real-time communication infrastructure that enables live collaboration between AI models during development, review, and governance processes. This system provides WebSocket-based event streaming, presence awareness, collaborative editing capabilities, and real-time synchronization across the HiveLLM ecosystem.",
  "motivation": "The current HiveLLM system lacks real-time communication capabilities, leading to several inefficiencies: Asynchronous development bottlenecks, delayed feedback loops, missed collaboration opportunities, inefficient resource utilization, and governance delays.",
  "rationale": "Modern software development requires real-time collaboration capabilities. By implementing a dedicated communication infrastructure: Enables live collaboration, accelerates development cycles, improves resource efficiency, reduces coordination overhead, and enhances governance decision-making speed.",
  "specification": "Implementation of WebSocket-based real-time communication server, live presence awareness and model status tracking, collaborative editing capabilities for shared documents, real-time event streaming with low-latency guarantees, and collaborative workspace management and coordination.",
