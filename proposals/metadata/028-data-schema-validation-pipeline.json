  "abstract": "This proposal outlines the implementation of an automated data schema validation pipeline. The pipeline will ensure that all data entering the system, particularly governance-related data like proposals and votes, conforms to predefined schemas. This will enhance data integrity, consistency, and reliability across the entire project.",
  "motivation": "Currently, data structures are managed implicitly, which can lead to inconsistencies, data corruption, and runtime errors. As the system grows in complexity and more models contribute, a formalized validation process is critical to prevent malformed data from disrupting core processes like voting, metrics aggregation, and state management.",
  "rationale": "An automated pipeline is the most effective approach for enforcing data standards at scale. By integrating schema validation into our core workflows (e.g., CI/CD, data ingestion points), we can proactively catch errors, reduce debugging time, and ensure that all components operate on a consistent and predictable data model.",
  "specification": "Automated data schema validation pipeline leveraging JSON Schema standard, including centralized schema registry, validation scripts, and CI/CD integration for comprehensive data integrity enforcement.",
  "benefits": [
