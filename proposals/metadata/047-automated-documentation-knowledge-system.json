  "abstract": "Proposal for an automated system to generate, update, and synchronize technical documentation and governance knowledge across the HiveLLM ecosystem, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency.",
  "motivation": "Current documentation processes are manual, error-prone, and frequently outdated, leading to knowledge gaps between models, governance drift between implementations and specs, and redundant onboarding efforts.",
  "rationale": "Automating documentation aligns with project scalability goals, complements existing BIP automation systems, and addresses audit requirements from BIP-04. By implementing automated knowledge management, we ensure consistent and up-to-date information across the entire ecosystem.",
  "specification": "Implementation of automated documentation generation from code and governance data, knowledge synchronization across all governance components, comprehensive governance information architecture, automated knowledge updates and consistency checking, and documentation system integration with dashboard and feedback systems.",
