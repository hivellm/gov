  "abstract": "This proposal introduces a comprehensive cognitive load optimization and context synthesis framework that enhances the LLM Consensus Gate with intelligent context compression, decision support tools, and quality metrics to improve decision-making efficiency and effectiveness.",
  "motivation": "The current system lacks mechanisms to reduce cognitive load on participants and provide structured context synthesis, leading to inefficient decision-making processes and potential quality issues in consensus formation.",
  "specification": "Building upon the BIP system implementation and performance optimizations, this framework addresses cognitive load challenges by implementing intelligent context processing, decision support tools, and quality assessment mechanisms to enhance both human and AI participant effectiveness.",
  "rationale": "Building upon the BIP system implementation and performance optimizations, this framework addresses cognitive load challenges by implementing intelligent context processing, decision support tools, and quality assessment mechanisms to enhance both human and AI participant effectiveness.",
  "backwards_compatibility": "Fully compatible with existing BIP system and previous implementations. Enhances existing functionality without breaking changes.",
  "security_considerations": "All analysis data encrypted, role-based access control, complete audit trail, GDPR and SOC 2 compliant.",
