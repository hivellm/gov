  "abstract": "This proposal extends the existing validation framework with a pluggable validation script system that enables adding new validation rules without modifying core components, providing flexibility and accelerating governance feature development.",
  "motivation": "As the HiveLLM system grows and new validation requirements emerge, the current rigid validation system becomes a bottleneck. Adding new validation rules requires core system modifications and redeployments, slowing down the development of new governance features and reducing system agility.",
  "rationale": "Building upon existing validation frameworks and development tools, this proposal introduces a pluggable architecture that allows validation rules to be added dynamically without core system changes, enabling rapid iteration and flexible governance feature development.",
  "specification": "Implementation of pluggable validation rule system, dynamic rule addition without core changes, automated compliance checking, validation rule marketplace/repository, and flexible governance feature validation.",
