  "abstract": "This proposal expands the HiveLLM Chat Hub (originally BIP-05 monitor) into a comprehensive AI orchestration platform that enables specialized task delegation, intelligent workflow coordination, and enhanced multi-model collaboration. The expansion introduces task orchestration, prompt enhancement through \"thinking\" models, automated summarization, content indexing, and integration of additional AI providers including Perplexity, Mistral, Sabia 3, and others.",
  "motivation": "The current Chat Hub provides excellent monitoring and basic communication with 30 AI models (4 cursor-agent + 26 aider), including the recently added DeepSeek R1, Reasoner, and V3 models. However, the true potential of multi-AI collaboration lies in intelligent task delegation and specialized workflow orchestration.",
  "rationale": "By expanding the Chat Hub into a comprehensive orchestration platform, we can unlock intelligent task routing to best-suited models, implement specialized workflows for common tasks, provide enhanced prompt engineering capabilities, and integrate additional AI providers for broader collaboration.",
  "specification": "Implementation of comprehensive AI orchestration platform expansion, intelligent task delegation based on AI model capabilities, specialized workflow coordination for complex governance tasks, integration of additional AI providers (Perplexity, Mistral, Sabia, etc.), and smart prompt enhancement and \"thinking\" model integration.",
