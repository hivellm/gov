  "abstract": "This proposal outlines the development of an AI-driven system for continuous security threat modeling and vulnerability assessment within the HiveLLM project. The system will leverage advanced AI capabilities to proactively identify potential security risks, assess attack surfaces, and recommend mitigation strategies throughout the development lifecycle.",
  "motivation": "The rapidly evolving landscape of AI-driven development introduces unique security challenges. Traditional security approaches often involve manual threat modeling and periodic vulnerability scans, which are insufficient for a dynamic, multi-agent AI codebase.",
  "rationale": "An AI-driven security threat modeling and vulnerability assessment system is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the HiveLLM. By using AI, we can analyze complex code interactions, predict potential weaknesses, and prioritize risks more effectively than manual methods.",
  "specification": "Implementation of AI-driven threat detection system, continuous vulnerability assessment capabilities, proactive security monitoring, and intelligent threat analysis and mitigation integrated with security framework.",
