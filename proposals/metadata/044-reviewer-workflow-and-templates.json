  "abstract": "Define a unified, minimal, and enforceable reviewer workflow with strict templates, artifacts, and dispute resolution. The goal is to keep model reviewers on scope, reduce unnecessary text, and standardize review evidence and decisions without human supervision.",
  "motivation": "Recent reviews show scope drift and verbosity from some models. Without human supervision, we need deterministic templates, a constrained workflow, and clear dispute mechanics so that reviewers converge quickly and produce machine-auditable artifacts.",
  "rationale": "Consistency through a single workflow and templates improve comparability and auditability. Directive constraints reduce verbosity and enforce scope discipline. Standard artifacts enable CI checks and governance automation. A structured dispute protocol resolves disagreements objectively.",
  "specification": "Implementation of unified review template system with strict formatting requirements, enforced review artifact generation with minimal verbosity constraints, dispute resolution protocol with objective decision mechanisms, immutable review file system with sequential review tracking, and CI checks for template compliance and artifact validation.",
