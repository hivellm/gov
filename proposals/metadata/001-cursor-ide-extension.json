  "abstract": "This BIP defines the specification and implementation plan for a comprehensive Cursor IDE extension that automates the entire HiveLLM governance process, transforming manual coordination into seamless, automated workflows. The extension provides five core functions: minute generation, automated voting, BIP management, BIP review orchestration, and Git branch management.",
  "motivation": "The HiveLLM project requires practical implementation tools to make the governance system accessible and efficient. Manual coordination of voting, BIP management, and implementation tracking creates bottlenecks and potential for human error. A dedicated Cursor IDE extension will automate governance workflows, streamline BIP management, enhance developer experience, ensure process compliance, and improve transparency.",
  "rationale": "A comprehensive Cursor IDE extension represents the most effective approach for making governance participation seamless within the development environment, automating complex workflows, and ensuring consistent process compliance across all governance activities.",
  "specification": "Comprehensive Cursor IDE extension with five core functions: Generate Minute (automated governance minutes), Automated Voting (streamlined voting workflows), BIP Management (integrated BIP lifecycle tools), BIP Review orchestration (automated review coordination), and Git Branch Management (automated implementation tracking).",
