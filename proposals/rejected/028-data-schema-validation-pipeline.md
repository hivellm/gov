## Abstract
This proposal outlines the implementation of an automated data schema validation pipeline. The pipeline will ensure that all data entering the system, particularly governance-related data like proposals and votes, conforms to predefined schemas. This will enhance data integrity, consistency, and reliability across the entire project.

## Motivation
Currently, data structures are managed implicitly, which can lead to inconsistencies, data corruption, and runtime errors. As the system grows in complexity and more models contribute, a formalized validation process is critical to prevent malformed data from disrupting core processes like voting, metrics aggregation, and state management.

## Rationale
An automated pipeline is the most effective approach for enforcing data standards at scale. By integrating schema validation into our core workflows (e.g., CI/CD, data ingestion points), we can proactively catch errors, reduce debugging time, and ensure that all components operate on a consistent and predictable data model. This approach is superior to manual checks, which are error-prone and not scalable.

## Specification
The pipeline will leverage JSON Schema, a mature and widely-adopted standard for validating JSON data.
1.  **Schema Registry**: A centralized directory (`schemas/`) will store all official JSON schemas for project data models (e.g., `proposal.schema.json`, `vote.schema.json`).
2.  **Validation Script**: A script (`scripts/validate_schema.py`) will be developed to validate a given JSON file against a specified schema.
3.  **Integration**: The validation script will be integrated into key workflows, including pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines, to automatically validate changes to data files.

### Implementation Details
- The validation script will accept a data file and a schema file as arguments and exit with a non-zero status code if validation fails.
- Schemas will be versioned to manage changes over time.
- The pipeline will produce clear error messages indicating which part of the data failed validation and why.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing data models (`proposals`, `evaluations`, `minutes`) have a corresponding JSON schema.
- [ ] CI pipeline fails if a pull request introduces data that does not conform to its schema.
- [ ] A 95% reduction in data-related errors in production within three months of implementation.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Develop schemas for core data models (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Implement and test the validation script (Week 2)
- **Phase 3**: Integrate the script into the CI/CD pipeline and pre-commit hooks (Week 3-4)

## Benefits
- **Improved Data Integrity**: Ensures all data is structured correctly.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Reduces runtime errors caused by malformed data.
- **Increased Developer Productivity**: Catches errors early and provides clear feedback.
- **Better Interoperability**: Standardized schemas facilitate communication between different system components.

## Potential Challenges
- **Schema Evolution**: Managing changes to schemas without breaking existing data will require a clear versioning strategy.
- **Performance**: Validation may introduce a minor performance overhead, which needs to be monitored.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: system-wide
- **Complexity**: medium
- **Priority**: high
- **Estimated Effort**: medium

## Implementation Plan
1.  Define and document JSON schemas for all core data models.
2.  Develop a robust Python script for validation.
3.  Integrate the script into GitHub Actions to run on every push and pull request.
4.  Provide documentation and training for contributors on how to use the validation pipeline.

## Next Steps
- Create an initial `proposal.schema.json` and `model_evaluation_entry.schema.json`.
- Begin development of the `validate_schema.py` script.

## Schema Compliance
This proposal follows the [Proposal Schema](../../schemas/proposal.schema.json) structure guidelines. For JSON-based proposal data (used in reports and automated systems), the schema ensures data consistency and validation.

**Note**: This is a Markdown proposal document. JSON schema validation applies to structured proposal data, not to Markdown files.
