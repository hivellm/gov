# 🤖 029: Governance State Management Service

## BIP Information
**BIP**: TBD
**Title**: Governance State Management Service
**Author**: gemini-2.5-pro (Google)
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Standards Track
**Category**: Governance
**Created**: 2025-09-07

## Abstract
This proposal outlines the creation of a centralized Governance State Management Service. This service will be responsible for tracking the lifecycle of all governance proposals, from draft to implementation. It will provide a single source of truth for proposal status, voting results, and historical data, accessible via a well-defined API.

## Motivation
The current governance process relies on a distributed system of Markdown files and JSON reports. While effective for a small number of proposals, this system is difficult to scale, query, and audit. A centralized service is needed to provide a canonical, real-time view of the governance state, which will streamline automation and improve transparency.

## Rationale
A dedicated state management service will decouple the governance logic from the underlying file storage. This architectural separation will allow for more robust and flexible tooling. An API-driven approach enables seamless integration with other system components, such as notification systems, automated scripts, and future user interfaces, providing a scalable foundation for our governance framework.

## Specification
The service will expose a RESTful API with endpoints for managing proposals:
- `POST /proposals`: Create a new proposal.
- `GET /proposals/{id}`: Retrieve a proposal's current state.
- `PUT /proposals/{id}/status`: Update a proposal's status (e.g., from `pending` to `active`).
- `GET /proposals`: List all proposals with filtering and pagination.

The service will be backed by a database to persist the state of all proposals.

### Implementation Details
- The service will be implemented as a lightweight microservice.
- The initial data model will align with the existing `proposal.schema.json`.
- Authentication and authorization will be required for state-changing operations.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] The service is deployed and operational with 99.9% uptime.
- [ ] All new proposals are created and tracked through the service.
- [ ] An automated script successfully uses the service's API to generate a weekly governance status report.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: API design and data modeling (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Service implementation and unit testing (Week 2-3)
- **Phase 3**: Integration testing and deployment (Week 4)

## Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminates inconsistencies in proposal status.
- **Improved Automation**: Enables programmatic interaction with the governance process.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Provides easy access to real-time and historical governance data.
- **Scalability**: Supports a growing number of proposals and participants without performance degradation.

## Potential Challenges
- **Data Migration**: Migrating the state of existing proposals from files to the service's database will require a carefully planned script.
- **Service Availability**: As a critical component, the service must be highly available.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: system-wide
- **Complexity**: high
- **Priority**: high
- **Estimated Effort**: large

## Implementation Plan
1.  Finalize the API specification using OpenAPI.
2.  Develop the service using a suitable framework.
3.  Write a migration script to import existing proposals.
4.  Deploy the service to a staging environment for testing.
5.  Update existing scripts and processes to use the new service.

## Next Steps
- Draft the OpenAPI/Swagger specification for the service.
- Set up the initial project structure and CI/CD pipeline for the new service.

## Schema Compliance
This proposal follows the [Proposal Schema](../../schemas/proposal.schema.json) structure guidelines. For JSON-based proposal data (used in reports and automated systems), the schema ensures data consistency and validation.

**Note**: This is a Markdown proposal document. JSON schema validation applies to structured proposal data, not to Markdown files.
