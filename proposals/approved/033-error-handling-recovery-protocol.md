## Abstract
This proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for error handling and recovery within the CMMV-Hive system, implementing robust mechanisms to detect, manage, and recover from errors effectively while ensuring system resilience and continuous operation.

## Motivation
Errors and failures are inevitable in complex distributed systems like CMMV-Hive. The current system lacks comprehensive error handling mechanisms, leading to potential system downtime, data loss, reduced user trust, and inefficient recovery processes that require extensive manual intervention.

## Rationale
Building upon existing infrastructure and monitoring capabilities, this proposal establishes a standardized error handling and recovery protocol that ensures system reliability, maintains operational continuity, and provides comprehensive error tracking for continuous improvement of the governance ecosystem.
