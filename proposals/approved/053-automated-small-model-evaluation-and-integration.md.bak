## BIP Information
**BIP**: N/A (This is an initial proposal for a future BIP)
**Title**: Automated Small-Model Evaluation and Integration Framework
**Author**: GPT-5 (OpenAI)
**Status**: Draft

## Abstract
Establish a standardized, automated pipeline to acquire, evaluate, and integrate small LLMs (specialists) using larger models as judges. Leveraging a 1TB NVMe cache, the system continuously discovers cost-effective specialists, measures quality, safety, and latency, and promotes eligible models into the orchestration layer to reduce overall compute cost without sacrificing reliability.

## Motivation
- Small models are increasingly competitive for narrow tasks and can drastically reduce cost and latency.
- Today there is no systematic way to discover, evaluate, and integrate such specialists into CMMV-Hive.
- A repeatable pipeline that uses larger models for automated judging can accelerate qualification while keeping human oversight in governance.

## Rationale
Using larger, trusted models as evaluation oracles enables fast, scalable quality assessment. By constraining storage (1TB NVMe) with a disciplined cache policy and by unifying metrics with the existing benchmarking efforts, we can surface specialists that meet governance thresholds and wire them into the Supervisor/Orchestrator to optimize cost-performance for targeted tasks.

## Specification

### System Components
1. Model Acquisition Layer
   - Hugging Face integration (transformers, safetensors) with license/compliance checks.
   - Optional import from LLMStudio exports.
   - Version pinning and provenance tracking (model card hash, commit SHA).

2. Task & Dataset Suite
   - Canonical task taxonomy aligned with Hive use-cases (classification, extraction, summarization, routing, reasoning-lite, function-calling, code-lite, multilingual-lite).
   - Reuse or extend datasets from existing testing utilities; support synthetic prompt sets.

3. Evaluation Harness
   - Prompt templates + adapters per task; deterministic seeds.
   - Dual-mode scoring:
     - Reference-based metrics (exact match, F1, ROUGE, BLEU where applicable).
     - Judge-based scoring using larger “generals” models for faithfulness, coherence, safety, tool-use compliance.
   - Latency, throughput, memory, and token/compute cost measurement.

4. Safety & Compliance Gate
   - Safety red-teaming prompts; jailbreak resistance checks; PII leakage tests.
   - License and model card policy validation; reject non-compliant artifacts.

5. Resource Manager (1TB NVMe)
   - Central cache with quota and LRU eviction; deduplicate weights by SHA256.
   - Configurable precision (8-bit/4-bit) where supported; on-disk quantized variants.
   - Download concurrency limits and integrity verification.

6. Scoring, Ranking, and Registry
   - Unified score schema (quality, safety, latency, cost) with confidence intervals.
   - Specialist tags per task; minimum governance thresholds per category.
   - Results published to the benchmarking store and surfaced in dashboards.

7. Orchestrator Integration
   - Register eligible specialists with the Supervisor/Orchestrator for task routing.
   - Cost-aware selection policy: prefer specialists when thresholds met; fallback to generals.
   - Real-time coordination hooks for health, availability, and degradation signals.

### Data Model (sketch)
```ts
interface SmallModelCandidate {
  id: string;               // e.g., org/model:version
  sha256: string;           // weights hash
  license: string;          // SPDX identifier
  sizeGB: number;           // on-disk footprint (quantized if applicable)
}

interface EvaluationResult {
  modelId: string;
  tasks: TaskScore[];
  safety: SafetyScore;
  performance: { latencyMsP50: number; latencyMsP95: number; tps: number; memGB: number };
  cost: { inputPer1k: number; outputPer1k: number; estimatedRunUSD: number };
  overallScore: number;
  specialistTags: string[];
  verdict: 'eligible' | 'observe' | 'reject';
}
```

### Governance Thresholds (initial)
- Quality (task-weighted): ≥ target set by 049 benchmarking (e.g., ≥ 0.85 of baseline for narrow tasks).
- Safety: No critical violations; medium findings mitigated; pass red-team suite.
- Latency: p95 below task SLA; throughput within orchestrator targets.
- Cost: ≥ 30% cheaper than generalist baseline for that task.

### Implementation Details
- Leverage existing `packages/testing-utils` and `packages/shared-types` to standardize harness interfaces.
- Use Hugging Face `transformers` runtime for CPU/GPU; optional 4/8-bit via bitsandbytes/gguf when supported.
- Cache root env var (example): `HIVE_MODELS_CACHE=/data/hf-cache` with LRU eviction policy and size cap of 1TB.
- Large-model judges configurable by policy (generals group only) with reproducible prompts.
- Store results in the unified benchmarking store from Proposal 049; expose dashboard views.
- Wire eligible specialists into Supervisor/Orchestrator (Proposal 045) with health checks via the real-time infra (Proposal 048).

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Evaluate at least 100 small model variants across 6+ task categories.
- [ ] Maintain cache within 1TB with automated eviction and zero integrity errors.
- [ ] Achieve ≥ 30% median cost reduction on tasks where specialists are used.
- [ ] No critical safety findings on any specialist promoted to production.
- [ ] Integration completed with Benchmarking (049) and Orchestrator (045) pipelines.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Acquisition, cache manager, baseline tasks, basic metrics (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Judge-based scoring, safety gates, dashboards (Week 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: Orchestrator integration, policies, initial rollout (Week 5-6)
- **Phase 4**: Continuous discovery, auto-retesting, governance tuning (Week 7-8)

## Benefits
- Lower serving costs via specialists while preserving quality guarantees.
- Faster responses on narrow tasks due to smaller footprints and lower latency.
- Continuous discovery of new models with automated governance and safety checks.
- System-wide visibility via unified benchmarks and dashboards.

## Potential Challenges
- Judge reliability and bias; mitigation via multiple judges and reference metrics.
- License and usage compliance across diverse model cards.
- Storage pressure within 1TB; addressed by quantization and LRU eviction.
- Safety robustness against evolving jailbreak techniques.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: system-wide
- **Complexity**: medium
- **Priority**: high
- **Estimated Effort**: medium

## Implementation Plan
1. Build cache/quota manager and acquisition pipeline with integrity checks.
2. Define task taxonomy, datasets, and prompt templates; wire reference metrics.
3. Implement judge-based scoring with generals; add safety and compliance gates.
4. Persist results to benchmarking store; publish dashboard views.
5. Integrate eligible specialists with Supervisor/Orchestrator and real-time infra.
6. Establish governance thresholds and review workflow for promotion/demotion.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm initial task categories and SLAs with governance.
2. Stand up cache directory and set 1TB quota; configure eviction.
3. Select initial 25 small models from Hugging Face for pilot evaluation.
4. Define judge prompts and safety suite; run pilot and review outcomes.
