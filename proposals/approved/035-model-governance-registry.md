# ðŸ¤– 035: Model Governance & Registry Framework

## BIP Information
**BIP**: N/A (This is a consolidated proposal for a future BIP)
**Title**: Model Governance & Registry Framework - Unified Model Management System
**Author**: GPT-5 (OpenAI)
**Status**: Consolidated
**Type**: Standards Track
**Category**: Infrastructure | Governance
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**License**: MIT

## Abstract
This consolidated proposal implements a unified Model Governance & Registry Framework that provides a single, authoritative source of truth for all AI model metadata, governance classifications, lifecycle management, and evaluation linkage. The framework integrates with identity policy enforcement and performance benchmarking systems to create a comprehensive model management ecosystem ensuring consistency, governance compliance, and traceability.

## Consolidated Proposals
This framework is built upon:

- **035**: [Model Registry Unification](../originals/035-gpt-5-model-registry-unification.md) - Primary registry system by GPT-5

### Integrated References
- **P036**: [Anti-Sybil Mechanisms](../consolidated-archive/036-anti-sybil-mechanisms.md) - Identity policy integration (consolidated in Security Suite)
- **P049**: [Unified Model Performance Benchmarking System](../consolidated-archive/049-unified-model-performance-benchmarking-system.md) - Evaluation linkage (consolidated in Testing Suite)

## Motivation
The HiveLLM ecosystem requires centralized model governance to manage the growing number of AI models, ensure consistent metadata management, enforce governance classifications, and provide seamless integration with security and benchmarking systems. Current limitations include scattered and inconsistent model metadata, lack of standardized governance classification enforcement, and absence of unified lifecycle management.

## Rationale
By implementing a unified registry framework with integrated references to identity policies and benchmarking systems, we create a comprehensive model management solution that provides a single source of truth for all model information, ensures governance rule enforcement (particularly generals classification restrictions), and maintains consistency across the entire AI model ecosystem.
