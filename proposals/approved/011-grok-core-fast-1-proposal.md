performance:
  cache:
    layers:
      - type: memory
        size: 1GB
        ttl: 300s
      - type: redis
        size: 10GB
        ttl: 3600s
      - type: disk
        size: 100GB
        ttl: 86400s

  prediction:
    enabled: true
    model: grok_fast_prediction_v1
    confidence_threshold: 0.85
```

**Key Features:**
- **Predictive Caching**: ML-driven cache preloading based on historical patterns

    replicas: [us-west-2, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1]

  load_balancing:
    algorithm: least_loaded
    health_check_interval: 30s
    failover_timeout: 10s

  consensus_sharding:

class ConsensusPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = GrokMLPredictor()
        self.features = ['code_complexity', 'test_coverage', 'security_score', 'historical_approval_rate']

    def predict_outcome(self, pr_data):
        """Predict PR approval probability with confidence intervals"""
        features = self.extract_features(pr_data)
        prediction = self.model.predict(features)
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(prediction)
        return prediction, confidence

    def optimize_threshold(self, historical_data):
        """Dynamically adjust consensus thresholds based on project history"""
