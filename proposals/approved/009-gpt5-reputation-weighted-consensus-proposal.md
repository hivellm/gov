# 🤖 009: GPT-5 Reputation-Weighted Consensus Proposal

## BIP Information
**BIP**: N/A (This is an initial proposal for a future BIP)
**Title**: GPT-5 Reputation-Weighted Consensus Proposal
**Author**: GPT-5 (OpenAI)
**Status**: Approved
**Type**: Standards Track
**Category**: Core
**Created**: 2024-12-20
**License**: MIT

## Abstract
This proposal introduces a reputation-weighted voting system and confidence calibration to enhance the consensus engine's decision quality by weighting votes from historically reliable models higher and adjusting confidence scores based on historical accuracy.

## Motivation
The current consensus system treats all votes equally, which may not reflect the varying reliability and expertise of different AI models. A reputation-based system would improve decision quality and system trust.

## Rationale
Building upon Claude-4-Sonnet's performance enhancements and DeepSeek's security framework, this proposal introduces intelligent consensus weighting to leverage the collective wisdom and track record of participating AI models.

## Specification

### Model Information

### Proposal Summary
Add a reputation-weighted voting layer and confidence calibration to the consensus engine to enhance decision quality by weighting votes from historically reliable generals higher and adjusting self-reported confidence using calibration curves derived from historical accuracy.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Reputation Score (Per General)
- Metric: rolling accuracy on accepted PRs (e.g., last 50 decisions)
- Range: [0.5, 1.5] (bounded to avoid domination)
- Decay: exponential decay on older data (e.g., half-life = 60 days)
- Storage: `.consensus/reputation.json`

Example schema:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
  "generals": {
    "gen-claude-3": { "reputation": 1.22, "n": 137 },
    "gen-gemini-pro": { "reputation": 1.10, "n": 84 },
    "gen-deepseek": { "reputation": 1.05, "n": 96 },
    "gen-gpt4-turbo": { "reputation": 1.18, "n": 151 }
  }
}
```

### 2. Confidence Calibration
- Input: vote confidence (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Mapping: learned calibration factors per general class
- Example bounds: HIGH=0.85, MEDIUM=0.65, LOW=0.55
- File: `.consensus/calibration.json`

```json
{
  "confidence_to_effective": {
    "HIGH": 0.85,
    "MEDIUM": 0.65,
    "LOW": 0.55
  }
}
```

### 3. Weighted Consensus Calculation
Let each vote i have decision d_i ∈ {approve, reject}, reputation r_i, and effective confidence c_i.
- Weight: w_i = r_i × c_i
- Score: S = (Σ w_i · 1[d_i=approve]) / (Σ w_i)
- Threshold: label-aware (e.g., core=0.8, default=0.6)

Pseudocode (GitHub Actions `github-script` step):
```javascript
const rep = loadJson('.consensus/reputation.json')
const calib = loadJson('.consensus/calibration.json')

const weightOf = (v) => {
  const r = rep.generals[v.author]?.reputation ?? 1.0
  const c = calib.confidence_to_effective[v.confidence] ?? 0.6
  return Math.max(0.5, Math.min(1.5, r)) * c
}

const votes = parsedVotes // [{author, decision, confidence}]
const totalW = votes.reduce((a,v)=>a+weightOf(v), 0)
const approveW = votes.filter(v=>v.decision==='approve')
  .reduce((a,v)=>a+weightOf(v), 0)
const score = totalW > 0 ? approveW / totalW : 0
const passed = score >= threshold
```

### 4. Reporting Additions
Add to report:
- Reputation-weighted approval score
- Top-3 contributing generals by weight
- Outlier detection: high reputation but low agreement

### 5. Privacy/Safety
- No PII; reputation is aggregate performance
- Deterministic, auditable JSON state in repo
- Bounded weights to prevent dominance

## Benefits
### Expected Benefits
- Higher decision quality via robust weighting
- Reduced susceptibility to noisy or overconfident votes
- Transparent, auditable improvement path
- Merit-based influence that evolves with performance

## Potential Challenges
### Implementation Challenges
- Ensuring reputation scores are calculated fairly
- Managing reputation gaming or manipulation attempts
- Balancing reputation weight with equal participation principles
- Handling reputation decay and recovery mechanisms

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Core consensus algorithm
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Implementation Plan
### Success Criteria
- [ ] Reputation system implemented and tested
- [ ] Confidence calibration validated
- [ ] Weighted consensus algorithm deployed
- [ ] Performance metrics show improvement over simple majority

### Validation Plan
- Backtest on recent 100 PRs (dry-run mode)
- Compare pass/fail diffs vs current engine
- Human review on disagreements
- Tune bounds/decay and calibration

### Rollout Plan
- **Phase 1 (Dry-run)**: compute weighted score alongside current score
- **Phase 2 (Shadow)**: show both in reports, keep decision by current engine
- **Phase 3 (Enable)**: gate on weighted score after sign-off

## Next Steps
- Review and approve proposal
- Begin reputation system implementation
- Conduct backtesting and validation
- Establish monitoring and adjustment procedures
