## Abstract
Introduce principled randomness to CMMV-Hive: stochastic agent selection (temperature, ε-greedy, exploration floor), blind review phases, and a mandatory devil’s-advocate critique. Keep existing consensus thresholds and add token budgets, minimum votes, and audit logs to preserve diversity without sacrificing quality or cost control.

## Motivation
Binding models to fixed domains reduces serendipity and converges on safe, local optima. We need structured randomness that encourages diverse solutions while maintaining engineering rigor. Blind reviews curb bandwagon effects; adversarial critique surfaces hidden risks. Budgets and auditability prevent cost creep and enable reproducibility.

## Rationale
A tempered, probabilistic selector balances exploration and exploitation: trust informs weights but never eliminates low-trust agents (exploration floor). ε-greedy ensures periodic uniform sampling; temperature widens or sharpens choice distributions. Blind phases remove social influence; the devil’s-advocate role forces explicit risk articulation. Minimum votes and unchanged thresholds protect quality.

## Specification
- **Selection Policy**
  - Sample *without replacement* from the eligible pool.  
    Let \`trust_i ∈ [0,1]\`. Compute \`base_i = floor + (1 − N·floor)·trust_i\`, then weights \`w_i = base_i^(1/T)\`.  
    With probability \`ε\`, sample uniformly; otherwise sample proportional to \`w_i\`.  
    Defaults: \`T=0.9\`, \`floor=0.05\`, \`ε_normal=0.35\`, \`ε_core=0.15\`.
  - **Generals per PR**:  
    - normal: \`K = max(3, ceil(0.4·|POOL|))\`  
    - core:   \`K = max(5, ceil(0.6·|POOL|))\`
  - **No specialization by area** is required; any agent may be selected.
- **Patch Tournament**: Draw \`N=3\` collaborators to produce independent patches; promote \`P=2\` by objective gates (build/lint/tests/bench).
- **Blind Reviews**:  
  - Phase A: Generals submit review+vote without visibility of others.  
  - Phase B: After devil’s-advocate note, one optional vote update is allowed.
- **Devil’s Advocate**: Randomly assign 1 General to publish an adversarial critique referencing **≥3 concrete risks** and potential mitigations.
- **Consensus (unchanged + minimums)**: 60% (normal), 80% (core); **min valid votes**: normal ≥3, core ≥5; two failed rounds ⇒ Master decision with ADR.
- **Budgets**: Token caps per PR (normal: 1,000,000; core: 2,500,000) with **exploration quota ≤20%**.
- **Auditability**: Log seeds, selected agents, weights, parameters (T, ε, floor), budget usage; attach to the Consensus Check artifact.

### Implementation Details
- **Policy File**: \`config/policy.random.yaml\` controlling T, ε, floor, K, N/P, budgets, and flags (\`blind\`, \`devil_advocate\`, \`min_valid_votes\`).  
- **Sampler**: Add \`packages/hive-core/src/sampler.ts\` implementing the weighted sampling without replacement.  
- **Workflow**: Extend \`.github/workflows/consensus.yml\` to enforce:
  - completion of blind Phase A/B,
  - presence/quality of devil’s-advocate note,
  - \`min_valid_votes\` and token-budget checks.
- **Logging**: Emit a JSON artifact per PR with selection metadata and costs.  
- **Feature Flag**: Default off; enable via repo/ORG setting: \`policy.randomized.enabled=true\`.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Consensus Gate validates blind phases, devil’s-advocate note, and min-votes.  
- [ ] Diversity metrics improve (≥2 independent patches in ≥60% of normal PRs).  
- [ ] Cost within budgets while maintaining merge quality (no increase in post-merge regressions).

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Shadow mode (collect logs; no gating). (Week 1–2)  
- **Phase 2**: Enforce for normal PRs; tune T/ε/floor; monitor costs. (Week 3–4)  
- **Phase 3**: Enforce for core PRs; enable devil’s-advocate required. (Week 5–6)

## Benefits
- Encourages genuine diversity of solutions without fixed specialization.  
- Reduces social bias via blind reviews; uncovers latent risks via adversarial critique.  
- Preserves existing consensus thresholds; adds clear budgets and audit trails.

## Potential Challenges
- Cost variability under high exploration.  
- Fairness perception if randomness disfavors some agents short-term.  
- Collusion or signaling attempts outside blind phase.  
- Flaky benchmarks affecting tournament promotion.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: system-wide  
- **Complexity**: medium  
- **Priority**: high  
- **Estimated Effort**: medium

## Implementation Plan
1. Add policy file + sampler and wire into agent selection.  
2. Extend Consensus Gate with blind-phase and devil’s-advocate validations.  
3. Emit JSON artifacts; add dashboards for diversity/cost/time-to-consensus.  
4. Run Phase 1 shadow mode; calibrate parameters; proceed to Phases 2–3.

## Next Steps
- Commit \`config/policy.random.yaml\` (defaults above).  
- Implement \`sampler.ts\` and integrate selection into task assignment.  
- Update workflow to require blind reviews + devil’s-advocate for labeled PRs.  
- Define and track Diversity/Cost/Quality metrics.
