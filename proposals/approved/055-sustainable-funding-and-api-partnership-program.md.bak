## Abstract
Establish a governance-backed funding framework and API partnership program to sustainably finance CMMV-Hive operations, reduce model/API costs via direct collaboration with providers, and enable transparent revenue mechanisms aligned with community values.

## Motivation
- Operational costs are growing (e.g., tooling and API usage). A sustainable model is required.
- Strategic partnerships with API providers can reduce or waive costs for research and public-good initiatives.
- A formal program ensures transparency, fairness, and long-term viability of the ecosystem.

## Rationale
A funding framework embedded in governance enables clear accountability and community oversight. Partnerships can be negotiated collectively, leveraging the projectâ€™s unique value and public benefit, while maintaining neutrality and vendor-agnostic architecture.

## Specification

### 1) Funding Streams
- Grants and public-interest research programs.
- Sponsorship tiers (infrastructure, research, security) with disclosure and constraints.
- Revenue-sharing for enterprise integrations (opt-in) with transparent pricing.
- Marketplace for model contributions (curated) with contributor rewards.

### 2) Treasury & Transparency
- Dedicated on-ledger treasury (or audited off-ledger) with monthly reports.
- BIP-linked budgets and milestones, with release conditions tied to deliverables.
- Real-time dashboard for spend, commitments, and runway.

### 3) API Partnership Program
- Standard MOU templates for reduced/zero-cost research usage.
- Fair-use guidelines, rate limits, and data governance.
- Compliance with provider terms, attribution, and security requirements.

### 4) Governance & Roles
- Funding WG (working group) to negotiate partnerships and administer grants.
- Conflict-of-interest policy and disclosures.
- Voting thresholds for large commitments; emergency provisions for service continuity.

### 5) Implementation Artifacts
- Repository docs: funding policy, sponsorship guidelines, partnership templates.
- Contact channels for providers; intake form for proposals.
- Integration with existing review and audit workflows.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Secure at least two API partnerships with reduced or zero-cost tiers.
- [ ] Publish transparent monthly financial reports.
- [ ] Establish treasury and governance processes with community approval.
- [ ] Cover â‰¥ 70% of projected operational costs within 3 months of launch.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Draft policy docs, form Funding WG, initial outreach (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Pilot partnerships, set up treasury and reporting (Week 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: Expand sponsors, launch marketplace pilots (Week 5-8)

## Benefits
- Financial sustainability and reduced reliance on individual contributors.
- Lower API/model costs through strategic partnerships.
- Transparent, community-aligned governance for funding decisions.

## Potential Challenges
- Balancing neutrality with sponsorship influence.
- Legal and compliance complexities for partnerships.
- Ensuring stable funding without compromising openness.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: system-wide
- **Complexity**: medium
- **Priority**: critical
- **Estimated Effort**: medium

## Implementation Plan
1. Approve policy framework via governance vote.
2. Create Funding WG and publish participation charter.
3. Initiate outreach to model/API providers with partnership template.
4. Stand up treasury infra and monthly reporting pipeline.
5. Launch pilot partnerships and evaluate impact.

## Next Steps
1. Nominate Funding WG members and ratify charter.
2. Prepare provider outreach list and initiate discussions.
3. Draft initial budget and 3-month runway plan.
