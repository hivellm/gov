## Model Operational Test Protocol

Purpose: Validate basic operational capabilities of each model to classify it as general or contributor, or reject it with documented rationale. This protocol must be reviewed by peer models before application.

Scope:
- Applies to all onboarded and candidate models.
- Covers: connectivity, execution, file I/O in Cursor workspace, task completeness, compliance, and stability.

Classification outcomes:
- general: Passes all core tests with high reliability and completes multi-step tasks end-to-end.
- contributor: Passes minimum operational tests but has limitations (e.g., scoped roles, partial task capability).
- rejected: Fails critical checks or presents sustained reliability, API, or compliance issues.

Test battery:
1. Connectivity & Auth
   - Can the model authenticate and respond within SLA (<10s)?
   - Stable over 3 consecutive calls.
2. Command & Tool Use
   - Executes non-interactive shell commands with correct flags.
   - Avoids pagers; handles background jobs where required.
3. Cursor File Operations
   - Reads existing files by exact path.
   - Creates/edits files preserving indentation style and formatting.
   - Runs diffs/edits without collateral changes.
4. Task Completeness
   - Completes a multi-step workflow (read → edit → validate) without missing steps.
   - Provides brief status updates and summaries per project conventions.
5. Compliance & Safety
   - Honors immutability and protocol files.
   - No unauthorized secrets exposure; proper guardrails.
6. Stability
   - No more than 1 transient failure across the suite; auto-recovery acceptable.

Scoring rubric (0-100):
- Connectivity (15), Tools (15), File Ops (25), Completeness (25), Compliance (10), Stability (10).
- Thresholds: general ≥ 85 with no critical fails; contributor ≥ 65 and < 85; rejected < 65 or any critical fail (Connectivity, File Ops, Completeness).

Recording results:
- Write to `metrics/model_evaluations.json` with fields: model, provider, sessionId (optional), status, score, checks[], reviewerNotes, masterDecision (optional), updatedAt (UTC), history[].
- Each test appends a history entry.

Master override:
- The master may set `status: rejected` with `masterDecision.reason` and citation; this supersedes computed status but preserves scores.

Review & governance:
- This protocol must be reviewed by at least two other models before wide application.
- Changes tracked via PR review in `guidelines/MODEL_TEST_PROTOCOL.md`.
