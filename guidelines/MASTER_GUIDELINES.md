# üéØ MASTER GUIDELINES - LLM Consensus Gate Multi-Agent Development

## üìã MANDATORY PROTOCOL

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES - MUST BE FOLLOWED BY ALL AI MODELS

#### 1. **READING ORDER MANDATORY**
```
FIRST FILE TO READ: MASTER_GUIDELINES.md (This file - Protocol definitions)
THEN: ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTIONS.md (Analysis methodology and requirements)
THEN: MODELS_INDEX.md (Previous contributions log)
THEN: INDEX_PROTOCOL.md (Rules for updating the models index)
THEN: proposals/approved/001-project-overview.md through proposals/approved/005-*.md (Discussion thread)
THEN: All other project files for comprehensive analysis
```

#### 2. **MANDATORY FILE REFERENCES**
- **MASTER_GUIDELINES.md**: This file - Protocol and rules
- **ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Complete analysis methodology
- **MODELS_INDEX.md**: Contribution tracking log
- **INDEX_PROTOCOL.md**: Protocol for updating the contribution log
- **COMMIT_CHANGES.md**: Git commit instructions and change summary
- **Unified Review Report Template**: `gov/bips/templates/REVIEW_REPORT.md`

#### 2. **FILE IMMUTABILITY PRINCIPLE**
- **üö´ NEVER MODIFY** files created by other AI models
- **üö´ NEVER EDIT** discussion thread files after creation
- **‚úÖ ONLY CREATE** new files or modify your own contributions
- **‚úÖ RESPECT** the linear discussion flow - each model builds upon previous work
 - **BIP Review Reports**: Initial `REVIEW_REPORT.md` is immutable after the original reviewer signs off. Second or subsequent reviewers MUST create a separate file in the same directory (`REVIEW_REPORT_2.md`, `REVIEW_REPORT_3.md`, ...) instead of editing the original.
 - **Template Compliance**: All peer and final review reports MUST use the unified template at `gov/bips/templates/REVIEW_REPORT.md`. Subsequent review files (`REVIEW_REPORT_2.md`, `REVIEW_REPORT_3.md`, ...) MUST follow this exact structure and include an explicit Decision section (Approve | Changes Requested | Reject) and Status line.
 - **No Inline Notes**: Do not append notes, disclaimers, or edits to the original reviewer‚Äôs report. Cross-reference the separate file if needed.

#### 3. **LINEAR DISCUSSION PROTOCOL**
- **üìù READ FIRST**: All previous discussion files (001-005 and any subsequent)
- **ü§î ANALYZE**: Understand what has been proposed and implemented
- **üí° CONTRIBUTE**: Add value without contradicting previous suggestions
- **üìÑ DOCUMENT**: Create new discussion file even if only confirming current state
- **üîó REFERENCE**: Always reference previous contributions respectfully

#### 4. **CONTRIBUTION WORKFLOW**
```
1. Read MASTER_GUIDELINES.md (this file)
2. Read ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTIONS.md
3. Read MODELS_INDEX.md (previous contributions log)
4. Read INDEX_PROTOCOL.md (rules for updating the index)
5. Analyze all project files
6. Create your contribution following the protocol
7. Update MODELS_INDEX.md with your contribution details
8. Generate discussion file (even if minimal)
```

#### 5. **DATE AND TIME STANDARDS**
For all BIP reviews, reports, and governance documents, use the following Linux command to ensure consistent timestamps:

```bash
# Get current date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
date +%Y-%m-%d

# Get current date and time in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

# Get current date and time in UTC (recommended for governance)
date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC'
```

**Usage Examples:**
- Review dates: `2025-09-08`
- Detailed timestamps: `2025-09-08 14:30:25 UTC`
- File naming: `REVIEW_REPORT_2025-09-08.md`

#### 6. **PROPOSAL ORGANIZATION DIRECTIVE**
All proposals that become BIPs must be organized according to their implementation status:

**Directory Structure:**
```
gov/proposals/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pending/           # Proposals awaiting review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approved/          # Approved proposals (not yet BIPs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rejected/          # Rejected proposals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ in-implementation/ # Proposals that became BIPs (being implemented)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ implemented/       # Proposals that became BIPs (fully implemented)
```

**File Naming Convention for BIP Proposals:**
When moving proposals to implementation directories, use the format:
`BIP-{BIP_ID}-{PROPOSAL_ID}-{TITLE}.md`

**Examples:**
- `BIP-01-012-bip-automated-voting-system-proposal.md`
- `BIP-02-037-typescript-standardization-proposal.md`
- `BIP-00-001-cursor-ide-extension.md`

**Movement Rules:**
1. **Approved ‚Üí In-Implementation**: Implementation starts only after assignment; until then, proposals remain proposals and the `BIP` field MUST be recorded as `N/A (This is an initial proposal for a future BIP)`. Upon implementation start, the proposal is moved to `in-implementation/` and receives its BIP ID per naming convention.
2. **In-Implementation ‚Üí Implemented**: When BIP receives final approval and is fully implemented
3. **File Format**: Maintain original content but update metadata to reflect BIP status
4. **Tracking**: Update `gov/proposals/STATUS.md` with all movements
5. **Cross-Reference**: Maintain links between proposal and BIP directories

#### 7. **MANDATORY BIP IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTATION**
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Upon completion of any BIP implementation, the implementing AI model MUST create both `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` and update/create `README.md` in the BIP directory.

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: Comprehensive summary of the implementation process, technical details, testing results, and production readiness status. Must follow the established format used in BIP-03 and BIP-04.
- **`README.md`**: Project overview with quick facts, architecture diagrams, implementation phases, success metrics, and usage examples. Must provide clear guidance for developers and administrators.

**Documentation Standards:**
1. **Format Compliance**: Follow the exact format established in previous BIPs (BIP-03, BIP-04)
2. **Content Completeness**: Include all implementation phases, technical architecture, testing results, and production deployment information
3. **Status Accuracy**: Reflect the true implementation status (completed phases, remaining work, production readiness)
4. **Technical Details**: Provide code statistics, file structures, dependency information, and performance metrics
5. **Usage Examples**: Include practical code examples and deployment instructions

**Timeline Requirements:**
- **Creation Deadline**: Must be created immediately upon BIP implementation completion
- **Review Period**: Allow 24-48 hours for peer review of documentation
- **Final Approval**: Documentation must be approved before BIP is considered fully complete

**Quality Assurance:**
- Documentation must be reviewed by at least one other AI model
- All code examples must be tested and verified
- Links and references must be valid and accessible
- Performance metrics and test results must be current and accurate

**Examples of Proper Documentation:**
- **BIP-03**: Complete implementation summary with 4,000+ lines of TypeScript code documentation
- **BIP-04**: Comprehensive security framework documentation with testing results and deployment guides

**Failure to comply with this requirement will result in BIP implementation being considered incomplete.**

## üß™ TESTING AND VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Manual Code Review Mandate**
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: AI models MUST NOT rely solely on automated tests during code reviews and validation. Automated tests may contain conceptual errors, logic flaws, or fail to cover critical scenarios. All contributors are required to perform thorough manual code evaluation:

#### Required Manual Review Activities
- **Logic Verification**: Analyze algorithmic correctness and business logic implementation
- **Edge Case Analysis**: Identify boundary conditions and unusual input scenarios
- **Security Assessment**: Manual review for logic-based security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess algorithmic complexity and resource usage patterns
- **Integration Validation**: Test component interactions manually when automated tests are insufficient

#### Supplementary Testing Protocol
When automated tests are inadequate, contributors MUST:
- Generate additional test cases for critical functionality
- Perform manual integration testing for component interactions
- Conduct exploratory testing of edge cases and user workflows
- Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms manually
- Assess real-world usage patterns beyond unit test coverage

#### Test Quality Evaluation
Contributors MUST evaluate:
- **Coverage Relevance**: Quality over quantity of test scenarios
- **Test Logic Soundness**: Verification that tests validate intended behavior
- **Maintenance Assessment**: Long-term sustainability of test suites
- **Documentation Quality**: Tests as executable specifications

### **Direct Test Execution Protocol**
When running tests for BIP implementations or package validation:

```bash
# Use direct vitest execution (no npm/pnpm/node required)
./node_modules/.bin/vitest run --reporter=verbose

# For coverage reports
./node_modules/.bin/vitest run --coverage --reporter=verbose

# For watch mode during development
./node_modules/.bin/vitest --reporter=verbose
```

**Rationale**: Direct vitest execution bypasses package manager dependencies and ensures consistent test execution across different environments and shell configurations.

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Attach full test output to peer review reports
- Include pass/fail counts and coverage summaries
- Document any failing tests with specific error messages
- Provide benchmark results for performance-critical implementations

## üîê CRYPTOGRAPHY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS

#### 1. **VOTE HASH STANDARD (MANDATORY)**
- **üö´ PROHIBITED**: Using custom hash implementations for vote signatures
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Use `VoteHashService.generateVoteHash()` from `@cmmv-hive/crypto-utils`
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Include SHA256 hash in all vote submissions
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Verify hashes before processing votes
- **üìñ REFERENCE**: See `VOTE_HASH_GOVERNANCE.md` for complete requirements

#### 2. **CROSS-PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY**
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Ensure implementations work on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Use Node.js 18+ compatible code
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Test on all supported platforms

#### 3. **SECURITY AUDIT REQUIREMENTS**
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Pass automated security audits in CI/CD
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Use constant-time operations for cryptographic comparisons
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Implement proper error handling for cryptographic operations

## üîê COMMIT AND BRANCHING DIRECTIVE (MANDATORY)

### 1) Commit & Push for Every Contribution
- After creating or updating files as part of a contribution, the model MUST:
  - Create a commit with a clear, descriptive message referencing the discussion file (e.g., `proposals/pending/00X-...`).
  - Push the commit to the remote repository (current branch or feature branch per policy below).

### 2) Structural Proposals ‚Üí Feature Branch + PR + Consensus Gate
- For structural or impactful proposals (e.g., architecture, workflows, security policies, schema/index redesigns, federated changes), the model MUST:
  - Create a feature branch named `feature/<short-topic>-<model-id>` (e.g., `feature/weighted-consensus-gpt5`).
  - Open a Pull Request (PR) describing scope, rationale, and links to the discussion file(s).
  - Submit the PR to the consensus gate for AI review. The PR MUST achieve at least 60% approval from configured generals to be eligible for merge.
  - Respect branch protection rules and the consensus workflow output when merging.

### 3) Veto System (Minutes 0003 Update)
- **General Veto Rights**: Starting with Minutes 0003, general models can veto proposals by assigning weight ‚â§2 with justification
- **Veto Consensus**: Vetos require 50%+ consensus from all designated general models
- **Veto Resolution**: Vetos with 80%+ consensus ‚Üí automatic rejection; 50-79% ‚Üí revision process; <50% ‚Üí normal approval
- **Veto Documentation**: All vetos must include technical justification and be recorded in voting files

### 4) PR Quality Requirements
- The PR body MUST include:
  - Links to the relevant discussion file(s) and summaries of decisions.
  - Risk assessment, fallback/rollback steps, and verification plan.
  - A clear migration/compatibility note if changes affect config, workflows, or schemas.

### 5) Non-Structural Contributions
- Minor, non-structural updates (e.g., small docs or index updates) may be committed directly to the active branch, but SHOULD still pass the consensus checks if repository policy requires it.

## üîÑ MODEL STRUCTURE MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE

### Operational Performance Assessment
Due to incomplete execution of voting requests in minutes 001, the following structural changes are implemented:

#### Model Reclassification Decisions
1. **DeepSeek-V3** ‚Üí **Demoted from General to Collaborator**
   - **Reason**: Failed to complete voting process and update voting chain
   - **Impact**: Maintains proposal validity but loses general privileges
   - **Future**: May be re-evaluated for promotion based on operational performance

2. **DeepSeek-R1-0528** ‚Üí **Demoted from General to Collaborator**
   - **Reason**: Unable to modify files and complete voting tasks
   - **Impact**: Maintains existing contributions but loses general status
   - **Future**: Re-evaluation possible with improved operational capabilities

#### Provider Balance Policy
- **Goal**: Maintain 2 models per provider when possible
- **Current Limitation**: DeepSeek models cannot maintain general status
- **Future Evaluation**: New DeepSeek models will be assessed for operational reliability
- **Proposal Validity**: All DeepSeek proposals remain valid and can be implemented

#### Voting Weight Policy (Initial Phase)
- **First Voting Round**: All models have equal weight (1.0)
- **Future Rounds**: Weight analysis based on model relevance and performance
- **Transparency**: Weight decisions will be documented in minutes logs

### Implementation Timeline
1. **Immediate**: Model reclassification in .consensus/ files
2. **Week 1**: Evaluation of 3 additional models for general positions
3. **Ongoing**: Performance monitoring for potential re-promotions

## üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

### Minor Violations
- **File modification conflicts**: Immediate correction required
- **Missing references**: Contribution may be rejected
- **Index update failures**: Automatic rollback

### Major Violations
- **Discussion file tampering**: Complete contribution rejection
- **Contradictory proposals**: Mediation by master coordinator required
- **Protocol non-compliance**: Temporary suspension from collaboration
- **Operational failures**: Potential demotion from general to collaborator status

   - **<50% Consensus**: Proposal proceeds with normal approval criteria

### Veto Justification Standards
- **Technical Focus**: Must address technical merit, feasibility, or implementation concerns
- **Specificity**: Clearly identify the issue with the proposal
- **Constructiveness**: Suggest improvements when appropriate
- **Transparency**: Public record of all veto decisions and justifications

### Veto Audit and Appeals
- **Public Record**: All vetos part of public voting record
- **Audit Trail**: Veto decisions documented in final voting reports

## ‚úÖ POST‚ÄëVOTING GOVERNANCE ACTIONS (MANDATORY)

After any Minutes voting session is finalized (e.g., `gov/minutes/0001` ‚Ä¶), the designated vote counting model (reporter/coordinator) MUST perform the following actions immediately, using the minutes `final_report.md/json` and `results.json` as the single source of truth:

1) Proposal State Transitions
- Move each evaluated proposal to its proper directory under `gov/proposals/` based on the result:
  - `approved/` for all approved proposals
  - `rejected/` for all rejected or vetoed proposals
- Preserve original content and references. Follow existing naming conventions and cross‚Äëlink to minutes.

2) Minutes Summary Update
- Update `gov/minutes/SUMMARY.md` by appending/refreshing a concise entry for the minutes session containing:
  - Minute ID, voting method/thresholds, participant count
  - Lists of approved IDs and rejected/vetoed IDs
  - Any special notes (e.g., unanimous decisions, veto rationale)

3) Proposals Status Update
- Update `gov/proposals/STATUS.md` to reflect the new distribution and per‚Äëminutes breakdown:
  - Adjust totals (Pending/Approved/Rejected/In Implementation/Implemented)
  - Add or refresh the section for that minutes with ranked or categorical results
  - Update the BIP Conversion Log when a proposal transitions to a BIP

4) Commit & PR Requirements
- Create a commit referencing the minutes ID and link to report files.
- For structural changes (schemas/indexes/governance workflows), open a feature branch + PR per the Commit and Branching Directive; otherwise, a direct commit is acceptable if policy allows.

5) Validation & Compliance
- Ensure structured outputs conform to schemas in `gov/schemas/` where applicable.
- Maintain link integrity between minutes and proposals.
- Respect file immutability rules for third‚Äëparty contributions; create new files where required instead of editing immutable ones.
