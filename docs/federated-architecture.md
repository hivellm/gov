# 🌐 Federated Architecture for Global Consensus

## Overview
This document describes the federated architecture for global scalability of the consensus system.

## Core Components
1. **Regional Clusters**
   - Autonomous vote processing units
   - Strategically located in different geographical regions
   - Responsible for 80% of local processing

2. **Global Consolidator**
   - Orchestrates results between clusters
   - Maintains trans-regional consistency
   - Implements RAFT protocol for inter-cluster consensus

3. **Geo-Aware Router**
   - Directs requests to the nearest cluster
   - Latency-based load balancing
   - Automatic failover between regions

## Data Flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant Repo as Repository
    participant Router as Geo Router
    participant Cluster as Regional Cluster
    participant Global as Global Consolidator
    
    Repo->>Router: Submit PR
    Router->>Cluster: Route to local cluster
    Cluster->>Cluster: Process regional votes
    Cluster->>Global: Send partial result
    Global->>Global: Consolidate results
    Global->>Repo: Return final result
```
