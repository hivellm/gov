## 🎯 System Overview

The LLM Consensus Gate is a distributed decision-making system that orchestrates multiple AI agents (LLMs) to collaboratively review and approve code changes through automated voting on GitHub pull requests.

### Key Characteristics
- **Distributed**: Multiple independent AI agents participate
- **Automated**: No human intervention required for consensus
- **Configurable**: Thresholds and rules can be customized
- **Transparent**: All votes and reasoning are publicly visible
- **GitHub Native**: Integrates seamlessly with GitHub workflows

## 🏛️ Core Components

### 1. Consensus Engine
**Location**: `.github/workflows/consensus.yml`
**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire consensus process
**Technology**: GitHub Actions with JavaScript

#### Responsibilities
- Validates configuration files
- Collects votes from all generals
- Calculates consensus metrics
- Generates detailed reports
- Makes final pass/fail decision

### 2. Generals (AI Agents)
**Location**: `.consensus/generals.txt`
**Purpose**: Individual AI agents that provide votes
**Technology**: Various LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

#### Characteristics
- Independent decision-making
- Specialized capabilities (security, performance, documentation)
- Configurable voting behavior
- Transparent reasoning process

### 3. Configuration System
**Location**: `.consensus/config.json`
**Purpose**: Central configuration management
**Technology**: JSON configuration files

#### Configuration Areas
- Consensus thresholds and rules
- Voting format and validation
- Notification preferences
- Workflow triggers and branches

### 4. Reporting System
**Location**: Built into workflow
**Purpose**: Provides detailed feedback and analytics
**Technology**: GitHub Job Summaries and PR comments

#### Report Components
- Consensus metrics dashboard
- Individual vote breakdown
- Recommendations and insights
- Historical performance data

    A[PR Created/Updated] --> B[Workflow Triggered]
    B --> C[Configuration Validation]
    C --> D[General Discovery]
    D --> E[Vote Collection]
    E --> F[Vote Validation]

    H -->|No| J[Status: Failure]
    I --> K[Generate Report]
    J --> K
    K --> L[PR Updated]
```

### Detailed Flow

#### 1. Trigger Phase
- PR opened, edited, or synchronized
- Label added/removed (core, hotfix, etc.)
- Workflow automatically triggered

#### 2. Validation Phase
```javascript
// Validate configuration
if (!fs.existsSync('.consensus/generals.txt')) {
    core.setFailed('Missing generals configuration');
    return;
}

// Validate generals
const generals = loadGenerals();
if (generals.length < requiredMinimum) {
    core.setFailed('Insufficient generals configured');
    return;
}
```

#### 3. Collection Phase
```javascript
// Collect all comments from PR
const comments = await github.paginate(
    github.rest.issues.listComments,
    { owner, repo, issue_number: prNumber }
);

// Filter and parse votes
const votes = comments
    .filter(comment => isFromGeneral(comment))
    .map(comment => parseVote(comment))
    .filter(vote => vote.isValid);
```

#### 4. Calculation Phase
```javascript
// Calculate consensus metrics
const totalGenerals = generals.length;
const approvals = votes.filter(v => v.decision === 'approve').length;
const ratio = approvals / totalGenerals;

// Apply threshold based on labels
const threshold = hasCoreLabel ? 0.8 : 0.6;
const passed = ratio >= threshold;
```

#### 5. Reporting Phase
- Generate detailed workflow summary
- Create PR comment with results
- Set workflow outputs for other jobs
- Log metrics for monitoring

## 🔒 Security Model

### Threat Model
1. **Configuration Tampering**: Unauthorized changes to config files
2. **Vote Manipulation**: Fake votes from non-general accounts
3. **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data in logs/comments
4. **Denial of Service**: Overwhelming the system with requests

### Security Controls

#### Access Control
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "contents": "read",
    "pull-requests": "read",
    "issues": "read"
  }
}
```
- Read-only access to repository contents
- No write permissions to code
- Controlled access to PR and issue data

#### Input Validation
- Strict validation of vote format
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Rate limiting and timeout controls
- Authentication verification for generals

#### Audit Trail
- Complete logging of all actions
- Immutable record of votes and decisions
- Timestamp verification for all events
- Hash verification for configuration files

### Trust Model
- **Generals**: Trusted AI agents with verified identities
- **Configuration**: Version controlled and reviewable
- **Workflows**: Executed in isolated GitHub runners
- **Reports**: Publicly visible and verifiable

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Current Limitations
- Maximum 100 comments per PR (GitHub API limit)
- Workflow timeout (6 hours default)
- Rate limits on GitHub API calls
- Memory constraints in GitHub runners

### Scaling Strategies

#### Horizontal Scaling
```yaml
jobs:
  consensus:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        general-group: [security, performance, quality]
    steps:
      - name: Collect votes from ${{ matrix.general-group }}
        # Process subset of generals in parallel
```

#### Caching Layer
- Cache general configurations
- Store historical voting data
- Implement result memoization
- Use external databases for large datasets

#### Asynchronous Processing
```javascript
// Queue-based vote collection
const voteQueue = new Queue();
votes.forEach(vote => voteQueue.add(vote));

// Process votes asynchronously
await Promise.all(voteQueue.processAll());
```
