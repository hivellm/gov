## 🚀 **Extension Capabilities**

### Five Core Functions

#### 1. 📝 **Generate Minute**
- **Command**: `CMMV-Hive: Generate New Minute`
- **Function**: Automatically creates voting minutes from unreviewed proposals
- **Process**: Scans discussion files, creates minute structure, initializes voting
- **Output**: Complete minute directory with summary, metadata, and voting infrastructure

#### 2. 🗳️ **Start Automated Voting**
- **Command**: `CMMV-Hive: Start Automated Voting`
- **Function**: Fully automated voting with AI model integration
- **Process**: Iterates through General models, collects votes, maintains voting chain
- **Features**: Real-time progress, automatic finalization, result processing

#### 3. 📋 **Manage BIP**
- **Command**: `CMMV-Hive: Manage BIP`
- **Function**: Complete BIP lifecycle management
- **Process**: Creates BIPs from approved proposals, assigns implementation, tracks progress
- **Rules**: >80% score = BIP creation, <80% = future recall, 3 rejections = permanent rejection

#### 4. 🔍 **Review BIP**
- **Command**: `CMMV-Hive: Review BIP`
- **Function**: Orchestrates comprehensive BIP reviews
- **Process**: Assigns all General models as reviewers, collects feedback, validates 80% threshold
- **Outcome**: Approval for merge or compilation of revision feedback

#### 5. 🔀 **Manage Branches**
- **Command**: `CMMV-Hive: Manage Branches`
- **Function**: Automated Git workflow for approved BIPs
- **Process**: Creates branches, tracks changes, validates merge eligibility, executes merge
- **Safety**: Comprehensive validation, conflict resolution, automated cleanup

## 📊 **Implementation Timeline**

### 10-Week Development Plan
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Extension Framework and Basic UI
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Automated Voting System
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): BIP Management and Review System
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Branch Automation and Git Integration
- **Phase 5** (Weeks 9-10): Testing, Polish, and Release

## 🔄 **Automation Workflows**

### Minute Generation Flow
```
Scan Proposals → Filter Unreviewed → Generate Minute ID → 
Create Summary → Generate Metadata → Initialize Voting → Notify Completion
```

### Voting Process Flow
```
Validate Prerequisites → Initialize Session → For Each Model:
[Context Preparation → Vote Collection → Vote Processing] → 
Completion Check → Reporter Selection → Post-Processing
```

### BIP Management Flow
```
Analyze Results → For Each Approved Proposal:
[BIP Creation → Implementation Assignment → Track Status] → 
Handle Rejected → Update Dashboard
```
