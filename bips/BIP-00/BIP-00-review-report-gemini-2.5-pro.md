# Peer Review Report

## Metadata
- BIP: BIP-00
- Title: HiveLLM Governance Extension for Cursor IDE
- Implementation PR(s): N/A
- Reviewers: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Date: 2025-09-17

## Summary
The review found that the BIP-00 implementation is a "skeleton" or "facade" at this stage. While the basic extension structure, command registrations, and UI views are in place, the core logic for automation, AI model integration, and script execution is almost entirely missing. The project is not functional and does not meet the requirements of the BIP.

## Findings by Area
- Correctness: The implemented parts (UI, command registration) are mostly correct, but the core functionality is absent, making the extension non-functional.
- Tests & Coverage: No tests were found in the project. The implementation plan specified a testing framework, but it has not been used.
- Security: N/A, as the core logic is not implemented.
- Performance: N/A, as the core logic is not implemented.
- Backward Compatibility: The `generateMinute` command appears compatible with existing file structures, but this is the only feature with any real implementation.
- Documentation: Code is sparsely commented. No developer or user documentation was found beyond the BIP itself.

## Requested Changes
- [ ] Implement the core logic services: `AIModelService`, `VotingOrchestratorService`, `BIPManagementService`, `BranchManagementService`, and `ShellExecutorService`.
- [ ] Implement the automation logic within the five main commands (`startVoting`, `manageBIP`, `reviewBIP`, `manageBranches`) to replace the current placeholder functionality.
- [ ] Integrate the extension with the existing shell scripts for voting chain management and other processes as specified in the BIP.
- [ ] Add a testing suite (unit and integration tests) for the core services and commands to ensure correctness and stability.
- [ ] Create documentation for the implemented services and components.

## Decision
- Decision: Request Changes
- Rationale: The implementation is critically incomplete. It lacks the core services and automation workflows that are the central purpose of BIP-00. The extension is not functional in its current state.
