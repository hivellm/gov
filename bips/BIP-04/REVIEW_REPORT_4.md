# Review Report

## Metadata
- BIP: BIP-04
- Title: Secure Script Execution Environment
- Implementation PR(s): feature/bip-04-secure-script-execution (branch)
- Review Type: Peer
- Reviewer(s): GPT-5
- Date: 2025-09-09

## Scope Verification
- Matches Approved BIP scope: Yes — Security layers, monitoring, policy, and auditing implemented per spec
- Compliance with coding standards: Yes — Type hints, structured logging, tests aligned
- Quality Gates met with evidence: Pending CI confirmation — local fixes applied; see evidence

## Findings by Area
- Correctness: Executor aligned with timeout/args behavior; optional PID resource usage handled safely
- Tests & Coverage: Imports fixed; assertions updated; requires CI run to confirm green
- Security: RLIM_INFINITY handled to avoid unlimited caps; deny-by-default domain policy enforced; JSON-only audit logs
- Performance: No regressions assessed in this pass; seccomp gracefully degraded if unavailable
- Backward Compatibility: No breaking changes exposed; migration and monitoring unaffected
- Documentation: `BIP-04.md` status harmonized; recommend updating summaries after CI

## Risks and Mitigations
- Resource limits might vary by host capabilities — Mitigation: apply configured finite values when hard == RLIM_INFINITY
- Seccomp not present on host — Mitigation: log and continue; optionally gate via config
- CI parity with local WSL — Mitigation: add Ubuntu job to run secure suite

## Decision
- Decision: Approve (conditional on CI green)
- Rationale: Prior blocking issues resolved; awaiting CI evidence to satisfy governance evidence requirements

## Evidence Links
- Test command: `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/secure/tests -t . --verbose`
- Code edits: `scripts/secure/executor.py`, `scripts/secure/audit.py`, `scripts/secure/tests/*`
- Documentation: `gov/bips/BIP-04/BIP-04.md`
