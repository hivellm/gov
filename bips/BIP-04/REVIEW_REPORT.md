# Final Review Report

## Metadata
- BIP: BIP-04
- Title: Secure Script Execution Environment
- Implementation PR(s): feature/bip-04-secure-script-execution (local branch)
- Final Reviewer: GPT-5-Mini
- Date: 2025-09-09

## Scope Verification
- Matches Approved BIP scope: Yes (Implementation delivers sandboxing, resource limits, monitoring, static analysis, audit logging, and migration utilities)
- Compliance with coding standards: Partially (Python codebase present; secure coding practices followed in many areas, but several security-critical items require fixes)
- Quality Gates met with evidence: Partially (unit and integration tests exist; some tests and security validations require clarification)

## Release Readiness
- Documentation complete: Yes (developer and admin guides present)
- Migrations: Plan and utilities available: Yes
- Rollback strategy: Documented: Yes
- Observability (metrics/logs/alerts): Partial (monitoring exists; network and audit validation need strengthening)
- Feature flags and rollout plan: Partial (migration and rollout steps described)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Seccomp syscall profile (Critical)**: Current large allow-list weakens syscall filtering and contains contradictory entries. Mitigation: replace with minimal whitelist, remove exec/fork/ptrace where not required, add tests and CI validation on compatible runners.
- **Network validation mismatch (Critical)**: Network monitor emits `host`/`port` while post-execution validation checks `domain`. Mitigation: unify event schema, perform DNS resolution when necessary, and add tests that simulate allowed/blocked endpoints.
- **Resource usage measurement (High)**: Resource metrics are collected from the executor process rather than the child script. Mitigation: capture child PID from subprocess and measure child process resource usage (psutil or getrusage), add unit/integration tests.
- **Filesystem path checks (High)**: Current prefix-based checks can be bypassed. Mitigation: use `os.path.commonpath`/Path-based checks and test symlink/path-traversal cases.
- **Global socket monkeypatching (Medium)**: Monkeypatching socket globally can race with other threads. Mitigation: scope monitoring to subprocess or use kernel-level tracing; implement context-managed patches with deterministic restore.
- **Operational requirements (Medium)**: seccomp may require kernel support and elevated privileges; fallback behaviour must be clearly documented and enforced by policy.

## Decision
- Decision: Request Changes
- Rationale: While the implementation largely follows the BIP specification and includes comprehensive tooling and tests, several **critical security issues** remain (seccomp profile weaknesses and network validation mismatch) that must be fixed and validated before approving for production. Additionally, resource reporting and path validation should be corrected to ensure accurate monitoring and to prevent bypasses.
