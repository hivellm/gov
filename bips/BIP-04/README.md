## 📋 Quick Reference

### Current Status: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND PRODUCTION READY**
**All phases completed successfully with 100% functionality**

### Key Commands
```bash
# Execute script securely
python3 -c "
from secure import SecureScriptExecutor
executor = SecureScriptExecutor()
result = executor.execute_script('script.py')
print('Execution successful:', result['success'])
"

# Run security tests
cd scripts/secure && python3 tests/run_tests.py

# Validate deployment
python3 scripts/secure/validate_deployment.py

# Analyze script security
python3 -c "
from secure import SecureScriptExecutor
executor = SecureScriptExecutor()
analysis = executor.analyze_script_security('script.py')
print('Risk level:', analysis['risk_level'])
"
```

### Configuration Files
```
scripts/config/security_policy.yml    # Security policy configuration
scripts/logs/execution_audit.log      # Execution audit logs
scripts/logs/security_events.log     # Security event logs
```

### Production Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install psutil PyYAML

# Deploy to production
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cmmv-secure-scripts
sudo cp -r scripts/secure/* /opt/cmmv-secure-scripts/
sudo cp scripts/config/security_policy.yml /opt/cmmv-secure-scripts/

# Configure system integration
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/cmmv-secure-scripts' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## 🔄 Migration Support

### Existing Script Migration
```python
from secure.migration import ScriptMigrationManager
from secure import SecureScriptExecutor

executor = SecureScriptExecutor()
migration_manager = ScriptMigrationManager(executor)

# Analyze script for migration
analysis = migration_manager.analyze_script_for_migration("old_script.py")
print(f"Compatibility: {analysis['compatibility_score']}%")

# Migrate if needed
if analysis['migration_required']:
    result = migration_manager.migrate_script("old_script.py")
    print("Migration result:", result['migration_successful'])
```

### Migration Patterns
1. **Replace direct execution**:
   ```python
   # Before
   subprocess.run(["python", "script.py"])

   # After
   from secure import SecureScriptExecutor
   executor = SecureScriptExecutor()
   result = executor.execute_script("script.py")
   ```

2. **Handle file operations**:
   ```python
   # Before
   with open("/unsafe/path/file.txt", "r") as f:

   # After
   with open("./data/file.txt", "r") as f:  # Use allowed paths
   ```

3. **Validate network access**:
   ```python
   # Before
   import urllib.request
   urllib.request.urlopen("http://example.com")

   # After - will be blocked unless domain is whitelisted
   # Requires security policy configuration
   ```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# View security statistics
python3 -c "
from secure import SecureScriptExecutor
executor = SecureScriptExecutor()
stats = executor.get_security_stats()
print('Total executions:', stats['monitoring_stats']['total_executions'])
print('Security violations:', stats['monitoring_stats']['security_violations'])
"
```

### Log Management
```bash
# Monitor execution logs
tail -f /opt/cmmv-secure-scripts/logs/execution_audit.log

# Monitor security events
tail -f /opt/cmmv-secure-scripts/logs/security_events.log

# Log rotation (example cron job)
# 0 2 * * * /opt/cmmv-secure-scripts/log_rotate.sh
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# System health validation
python3 scripts/secure/validate_deployment.py

# Performance monitoring
python3 -c "
import time
from secure import SecureScriptExecutor

executor = SecureScriptExecutor()
start = time.time()
result = executor.execute_script('test_script.py')
end = time.time()

print(f'Execution time: {end - start:.3f}s')
print(f'Overhead: {(end - start - result[\"execution_time\"]):.3f}s')
"
```
