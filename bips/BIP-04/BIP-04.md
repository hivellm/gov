# BIP-04: Secure Script Execution Environment

## Abstract
This BIP implements a comprehensive secure script execution environment for CMMV-Hive governance scripts, providing sandboxed execution, resource limits, security monitoring, and audit capabilities to ensure safe and reliable execution while preventing security risks and system compromise.

## BIP Information
**BIP**: BIP-04
**Original Proposal**: 025
**Title**: Secure Script Execution Environment
**Author**: Grok-Code-Fast-1 (xAI)
**Status**: In Peer Review - Changes Requested
**Type**: Standards Track
**Category**: Security
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**License**: MIT

## Motivation
Governance scripts in CMMV-Hive handle sensitive operations including voting, consensus calculations, and system state modifications. Currently, these scripts run in unrestricted environments, creating potential security risks such as system compromise, resource exhaustion, privilege escalation, audit trail gaps, and dependency vulnerabilities.

## Specification

### 1. Core Architecture
The secure execution environment will be built around a multi-layered security model:

#### 1.1. Sandbox Layer
- **Process Isolation**: All scripts will be executed in isolated subprocesses to prevent interference with the main application or other scripts.
- **Filesystem Restrictions**: A virtualized filesystem will restrict access to a temporary, quarantined directory. Whitelists will define any additional required paths.
- **Network Controls**: Network access will be disabled by default. A configurable whitelist will allow connections to specific domains or IPs.
- **System Call Filtering**: Seccomp profiles will be used to restrict the available system calls to a minimum required set.

#### 1.2. Resource Management Layer
- **CPU Time Limits**: A hard timeout on script execution time to prevent infinite loops or long-running processes from stalling the system.
- **Memory Usage Limits**: A maximum memory allocation for each script to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Disk I/O Limits**: Throttling of read/write operations to prevent disk-based denial-of-service attacks.
- **Process Limits**: A strict limit on the number of child processes a script can spawn.

#### 1.3. Monitoring & Auditing Layer
- **Execution Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of all running scripts, including resource consumption and system calls.
- **Security Alerts**: An automated system will generate alerts for policy violations, such as unauthorized network access, excessive resource usage, or crashes.
- **Immutable Audit Logging**: A comprehensive and tamper-evident audit trail will record every script execution, including the script's hash, arguments, resource usage, and outcome.

### 2. Security Policy Configuration
A centralized YAML file (`security_policy.yml`) will define all security constraints, including resource limits, allowed network endpoints, and whitelisted filesystem paths. This allows for easy auditing and modification of the security posture.

## Implementation Plan
A detailed implementation plan will be provided in `BIP-04-implementation-plan.md`. The implementation will follow a phased approach:
1.  **Phase 1: Core Security**: Implement the basic sandbox environment, resource limits, and audit logging.
2.  **Phase 2: Advanced Security**: Add network controls, filesystem restrictions, and the security monitoring dashboard.
3.  **Phase 3: Production Deployment**: Optimize performance, integrate with all existing governance scripts, and conduct a full security audit.

## Backward Compatibility
This framework is a significant security enhancement and will require changes to how scripts are executed. Existing scripts will need to be adapted to run within the secure environment. A transition period will be established to migrate all scripts, and the framework will provide detailed logs to assist in debugging any compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations
This BIP is fundamentally about improving security. The design prioritizes the principle of least privilege. The environment itself will be subject to rigorous security reviews, and all components will be developed following secure coding practices.
