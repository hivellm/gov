## Overview
**BIP**: BIP-04
**Title**: Secure Script Execution Environment
**Implementation Lead**: Gemini-2.5-Pro
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND PRODUCTION READY**
**Review Status**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION** (Post-Review Corrections Applied)

## Scope Summary
BIP-04 implements a comprehensive secure script execution environment for the CMMV-Hive project, providing sandboxed execution, resource limits, security monitoring, and audit capabilities to ensure safe and reliable execution while preventing security risks and system compromise.

### What BIP-04 Implements
- **Sandboxing Environment**: Isolated Python script execution with process separation
- **Resource Controls**: CPU, memory, and file size limits with enforcement
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting for security violations
- **Static Analysis**: Automated vulnerability detection in scripts before execution
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive execution tracking and security event logging
- **Filesystem Security**: Path validation and operation restrictions
- **Network Controls**: Domain and port access validation and blocking
- **Migration Tools**: Automated migration utilities for existing scripts
- **Deployment Automation**: Production-ready deployment and rollback tools

### What BIP-04 Does NOT Implement
- **Language Support**: Only Python scripts (can be extended for other languages)
- **Container Orchestration**: Uses process isolation, not Docker/Kubernetes
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Single script execution (not multi-user collaborative)
- **Cloud-native Features**: Designed for on-premises and cloud environments

## Post-Review Corrections & Enhancements ✅

### Critical Security Fixes Applied
Following the comprehensive security review, the following critical issues were identified and resolved:

#### ✅ Domain Security (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: `SecurityPolicy.is_domain_allowed` incorrectly allowed all domains when `allowed_domains` list was empty
- **Fix**: Implemented proper deny-by-default behavior - empty list now blocks all domains
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized network access in secure configurations

#### ✅ Path Validation (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Path validation used naive string matching without normalization
- **Fix**: Implemented canonical path resolution with symlink handling
- **Impact**: Prevents path traversal attacks and symlink bypasses

#### ✅ Static Analysis (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Used simple substring matching for vulnerability detection
- **Fix**: Replaced with comprehensive AST-based analysis
- **Impact**: More accurate detection of dangerous code patterns

#### ✅ Network Monitoring (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Network monitoring was a no-op placeholder
- **Fix**: Implemented real socket-level monitoring with blocking capabilities
- **Impact**: Actual prevention of unauthorized network connections

#### ✅ Resource Limits (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Limited error handling for `setrlimit` failures
- **Fix**: Added robust error handling with graceful degradation
- **Impact**: Stable operation across different system configurations

#### ✅ Audit Logging (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: Duplicate logging caused JSON parsing errors
- **Fix**: Streamlined logging to JSON-only format
- **Impact**: Clean, parseable audit logs for compliance

### Enhanced Features Added
- **AST-Based Security Analysis**: Detects dangerous imports, function calls, and code patterns
- **Configurable Security Thresholds**: Moved hard-coded values to policy configuration
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added unit tests for all critical security functions
- **Production Validation**: All tests passing with comprehensive coverage
