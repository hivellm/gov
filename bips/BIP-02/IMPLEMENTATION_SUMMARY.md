## 📋 **What Was Moved to Future BIPs**

The following components were **intentionally removed** from BIP-02 scope to maintain focus and enable dedicated development:

### **BIP-03**: Cursor Extension for Governance (Planned)
- VS Code/Cursor extension development
- Governance workflow integration
- Proposal creation and voting interfaces
- File system integration

### **BIP-04**: Voting Dashboard (Planned)
- Real-time voting monitoring
- Interactive proposal analytics
- Performance metrics visualization
- Historical data analysis

### **BIP-05**: API Services (Planned)
- RESTful API architecture
- Database persistence layer
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Authentication middleware

**Rationale**: Each component represents a separate concern requiring dedicated approval processes and implementation timelines.
