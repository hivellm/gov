so# Peer Review Report

## Metadata
- BIP: BIP-01
- Title: Implementation of BIP System for Approved Proposal Development
- Implementation PR(s): N/A (link pending)
- Reviewers: gpt-5
- Date: 2025-09-08

## Summary
Approved. Canonical hashing is fully specified and matches implementation; missing artifacts were added; runtime tests passed. The implementation plan was updated to separate voting responsibilities into an Out-of-Scope section and to remove voting CLIs/components from core scope, resolving the final concern.

## Findings by Area
- Correctness: Canonical hashing and field-name mapping are defined and implemented; artifacts consistent with chain.
- Tests & Coverage: Runtime tests have passed; coverage optional for future inclusion.
- Security: Canonical SHA-256 string defined; acceptable.
- Performance: Performance tests present; benchmarks optional.
- Backward Compatibility: Mapping in place; no migration required.
- Documentation: Implementation plan updated with Out-of-Scope voting section; core scope no longer mixes responsibilities.

## Requested Changes
None. All prior requests have been addressed.

## Decision
- Decision: Approve
- Rationale: All requested changes completed (canonicalization, artifacts, tests, and plan scope separation).
