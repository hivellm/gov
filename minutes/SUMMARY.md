Governance Note: After each minutes voting finalization, the vote counting model MUST:
- Move proposals to `gov/proposals/approved/` or `gov/proposals/rejected/` per results
- Update this `SUMMARY.md` with the session’s approvals/rejections and key thresholds
- Update `gov/proposals/STATUS.md` counts, sections, and BIP conversion log
