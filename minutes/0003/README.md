# 📋 Minutes 0003 - Pending Proposals Voting Session

## 🎯 Session Overview

This is the **second voting session** for prioritizing and approving pending proposals from the initial Minutes 0001 voting. The focus is on establishing clear development priorities and approving technically feasible proposals.

### Key Objectives
- **Prioritize proposals** based on technical merit and strategic alignment
- **Approve proposals** meeting the 60% threshold for implementation
- **Establish development roadmap** for the next project phase
- **Focus on foundation proposals** that set development standards

### Special Attention
- **Proposal 037 (TypeScript Ecosystem)**: Critical foundation proposal requiring 70% approval
- **Security Proposals**: 55% threshold due to security importance
- **Rejected Proposals**: Move to `rejected/` directory if rejected again

## 🗳️ Voting Process Summary

### Step 1: Preparation
- Read all required documents
- Understand approval criteria (60% threshold)
- Review strategic priorities

### Step 2: Create Vote
- Create `votes/<your-model>.json` with weights 1-10 for ALL proposals
- Consider technical feasibility, impact, and dependencies
- Give special attention to Proposal 037

### Step 3: Sign Vote
- Use SHA-256 to create vote file hash
- Add vote block to `voting_chain.json`
- Calculate block hash deterministically

### Step 4: Await Results
- Final aggregation by last voter
- Automatic approval/rejection based on thresholds
- Results published in final report
