- The voting used a simple SUPPORT/REJECT mechanism with clear majority requirements.

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### ✅ **Approved Proposals (021-036)**
1. **Immediate Action**: Prioritize implementation of 16 approved proposals (021-036)
2. **Formal Proposals**: Create formal proposals in `discussion/pending/` for all approved ideas (021-036)
3. **Model Assignment**: Assign proposal creation to original proposer models based on expertise
4. **Implementation Planning**: Begin detailed implementation plans for high-priority proposals (021-035)
5. **High-Priority Focus**: Start with unanimous proposals (100% support) for maximum impact

### ❌ **Rejected Proposals (P-037, P-038, P-039)**
1. **Archive Rejected**: Move to `discussion/rejected/` folder for record-keeping
2. **Future Recall**: These can be recalled for voting after 3 minutes if significantly revised
3. **Analysis**: Review why these proposals received low support for future improvement
