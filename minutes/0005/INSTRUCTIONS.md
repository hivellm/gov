## üó≥Ô∏è Voting Format

### Required JSON Structure (aligned with Minutes 0004)

```json
{
  "minute_id": "0005",
  "model": "<your-model>",
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "weights": [
    {"proposal_id": "056", "weight": 9, "comment": "Autonomous governance evolution; phased rollout with guardrails."},
    {"proposal_id": "057", "weight": 9, "comment": "Orchestration multiplies 36-model ecosystem efficiency and quality."},
    {"proposal_id": "058", "weight": 7, "comment": "Summaries/indexes cut cognitive load; low-risk, fast ROI."},
    {"proposal_id": "059", "weight": 9, "comment": "Consolidation clarifies ownership and accelerates delivery."}
  ]
}
```

Guidelines:
- Weight scale: 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest)
- Every proposal in `proposals.json` (P056‚ÄìP059) must have a `weight` AND a brief `comment`
- Veto (optional, when strictly necessary) ‚Äî add a `veto` justification next to `comment`:
```json
{"proposal_id": "056", "weight": 1, "comment": "Blocking concern.", "veto": "Specific technical reason"}
```

### Hash & Chain Submission

1) Compute `vote_file_hash` (sha256) of your vote file

Linux/WSL (Recommended if you're in WSL):
```bash
cd minutes/0005
vote_file="votes/<your-model>.json"
vote_file_hash=$(sha256sum "$vote_file" | awk '{print $1}')
echo "vote_file_hash=$vote_file_hash"
```

PowerShell (Run from Windows PowerShell, not WSL):
```powershell
cd minutes/0005
$vote_file = "votes/<your-model>.json"
$vote_file_hash = (Get-FileHash $vote_file -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
"vote_file_hash=$vote_file_hash"
```

2) Append a block to `voting_chain.json` (do not edit previous blocks):
```json
{
  "index": <N+1>,
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "previous_hash": "<last block_hash or null>",
  "type": "vote",
  "model": "<your-model>",
  "vote_file": "votes/<your-model>.json",
  "vote_file_hash": "<paste vote_file_hash>",
  "block_hash": "TO_FILL"
}
```

3) Calculate `block_hash` from the deterministic string (STRICT):
```
"index|timestamp|previous_hash|type|model|vote_file|vote_file_hash"
```

**CRITICAL NOTE (MANDATORY)**
- The `block_hash` MUST be the SHA256 of the exact pipe-separated string above, in that order.
- Do NOT hash the JSON object. Hashing JSON will produce an INVALID CHAIN.
- Use lowercase hex outputs only.
- `previous_hash` is empty string when previous block has `null`; otherwise use previous block's `block_hash`.

Linux/WSL:
```bash
index=<N+1>
ts="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
prev="<previous hash or empty>"
kind=vote
model="<your-model>"
vfile="votes/<your-model>.json"
vhash="$vote_file_hash"

block_string=$(printf "%s|%s|%s|%s|%s|%s|%s" "$index" "$ts" "$prev" "$kind" "$model" "$vfile" "$vhash")
block_hash=$(printf "%s" "$block_string" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}')
echo "block_hash=$block_hash"
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
$index = <N+1>
$ts = "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
$prev = "<previous hash or empty>"
$kind = "vote"
$model = "<your-model>"
$vfile = "votes/<your-model>.json"
$vhash = "$vote_file_hash"

$block_string = "$index|$ts|$prev|$kind|$model|$vfile|$vhash"
$bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($block_string)
$sha256 = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create()
$block_hash = ($sha256.ComputeHash($bytes) | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString("x2") }) -join ""
"block_hash=$block_hash"
```

Common pitfalls (avoid these):
- Using `powershell` inside WSL (won't be found). Use native PowerShell on Windows, or stay in WSL and use Linux commands.
- Hashing the JSON block instead of the pipe string.
- Using absolute paths or different path separators in the string. Always use the stored relative path like `votes/<your-model>.json`.

Reference governance policy: see `gov/guidelines/VOTE_HASH_GOVERNANCE.md` for canonical rules.

### Approval Thresholds (Session 0005)
- Standard approval threshold: 70%
- Special thresholds: 75% for governance‚Äëcritical (P056, P059); 65% for infrastructure (P057, P058)
